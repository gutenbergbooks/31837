<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/capE.jpg" width="100" height="160" alt="E" title="E" />
</div><p class="dropcap">arly in the morning of a long ago midsummer's
day, the inmates of a quiet
New England home were making unusual
preparations for the approaching repast.
The mistress of the house was ostensibly
overseeing the table; but there was an uncertainty
in her movements, which indicated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
a contradictory mingling of interest and abstraction,
such as agitates the mind, when
trifles intrude on more weighty matters. Not
so the maid in attendance, who had served
in her present capacity for more than twenty
years, and was without dispute an adept in
the culinary department, if not in affairs of
the heart. She was not so obtuse, however,
in the present instance, as not to perceive the
uncomfortable state of her mistress, and, notwithstanding the pressure
of business in hand, she magnanimously paused a moment to attempt a
word of comfort. How to approach a subject which had been continually
on the lips of the whole family for weeks, was now the poor girl's
difficulty. Every instant was precious. She was in a measure
neglecting the smoking viands under her supervision, and her long
established reputation as cook was in jeopardy. At this critical
juncture she blundered out, "Mrs. Sherman, it's a pity; indeed, it is,
that he, that Edward, is bent on going."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Recta," interrupted a musical voice
reproachfully, "ma is already convinced that
it is a pity Edward is going. It remains for
us to persuade her that he will speedily return."</p>

<p>"Bless my heart, is that Miss Louise?"
said Recta, turning to the person who had so
unceremoniously interrupted her condolements.
"Well, now, I declare," she continued,
"if I ain't beat. Young girls have great arts
of covering up their feelings. There's Miss
Louise taking on, and walking her chamber
all night, and now she's telling me what to
say as unconcerned as if this wasn't the last
meal she was going to enjoy with her only
brother."</p>

<p>"O fie, Recta, haven't I told you that Edward
is coming home again soon," said Louise,
and, she added with a blush, "You must
have heard kitty in your dreams, and magnified
her step into mine. You know you have
often said my tread was as light as Tabby's."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"But it wasn't, last night," persisted the
other, "it was as heavy as lead."</p>

<p>The blush deepened on the young lady's
cheek; not so much on account of the audacity
with which this privileged servant had
assailed her veracity, as for other and more
private reasons, herein unfolded. It was not
indeed, the distress occasioned by her brother's
departure, which, as intimated in the
preceding conversation, was about to occur,
that she desired to hide; but there was one
to accompany him, on whom she had bestowed
more than a sister's love, and furthermore,
this friend, having arrived the day before,
had progressed, perhaps farther in his suit
than on any former occasion, Such being
the state of the case, it was natural, that,
with her lover under the same roof, she should
be jealous of exhibiting feelings, others than
a sister's love would warrant. To cover her
confusion, therefore, which Recta secretly exulted
in having occasioned, she retorted;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Heavy footsteps! ridiculous! Look at
me," and she drew up her slight little figure;
"for shame, Recta; confess it was your heavy
ears, and I'll forgive you."</p>

<p>Recta compressed her lips and Louise immediately
changed her tactics.</p>

<p>"What a nice breakfast! Recta knows
what Ned likes, don't she, ma? Fie! Ned
wont stay long away from Recta and broiled
chickens, will he, ma?"</p>

<p>Recta's lips visibly expanded. "I reckon
he won't stay long away from Miss Louise
and flowers," said she, glancing at a beautiful
bouquet, which Louise held in her hand.</p>

<p>"Aren't they lovely, Recta? I've just
gathered them fresh for Edward. Now I'll
arrange them on the table, while you put on
the hot dishes.'"</p>

<p>"Gathered for Edward, as much as they
are for me," muttered the unconquered servant.
"Roses and forget-me-nots mean&mdash;well,
George Goodrich will know what they
mean; that's enough."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>As dispatch was no mean part of the cook's
accomplishments, it was not long before the
parties mentioned in her private conjectures
were seated at the breakfast table, in company
with the family, the names of all of whom
we know already. It will be observed that
allusion has been made to but one parent.
The memory of the other, still lived fresh in
the affections of his wife and children, and
deserves first notice among those whose plans
and persons we shall endeavor in a few words,
to introduce more minutely to the reader.</p>

<p>Judge Sherman was a man, who, through a
long and active life, was distinguished for inflexible
integrity, and, by means of sterling
talents, he rose to the first rank in his
profession as a lawyer. He married at an
early age, although his courtship approached
closely to the term of years which Jacob
served for Rachel. Political differences of
opinion were the obstacles which opposed his
suit. In those days the Federalists and Democrats
indulged in animosities as bitter as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
those which existed between the Jews and
Samaritans. The latter party, being in its
infancy, could ill afford to lose even a petticoat
from its ranks. Luckily for the young
Federalist, the lady of his choice was in her
heart a rebel to her father's will and purposes.
But after she became Mrs. Sherman,
the united influences of both did not annihilate
the opposite party, as its future history,
clearly demonstrates. The ball, set rolling
by Jefferson, continued to roll on, and Judge
Sherman, to the day of his death, never saw
his favorite principles triumph. In his efforts
of a pecuniary nature he was more successful.
He had accumulated a handsome property,
consisting mainly of many broad acres of well-cultivated
Massachusetts soil, which, for a long course of years, had been in
charge of a faithful and efficient tenant, occupying a cottage a short
distance from his own dwelling, a plain old-fashioned house, situated
on an airy knoll near the centre of his domains.</p>

<p>Here, for nearly two years after her husband's
death, Mrs. Sherman lived in seclusion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
receiving only occasional visits from her children,
Edward and Louise. The son being
engaged in studying his father's profession,
while the daughter was at school preparing
herself, it would be safe to say, to follow her
mother's business. Indeed, it was a fixed
fact in her own mind, that when George
Goodrich, her brother's warm friend and her
ladyship's still warmer admirer, should become
established in his profession as a physician,
she would then trust herself to his care,
without fear of poverty or disease. But the
young M. D. having no patrimony, and becoming
disgusted with the slow path in which
he was treading to fortune, resolved to turn
his course into a rougher road at the far
West.</p>

<p>About the same time, Edward Sherman,
having been admitted to the Bar, with no
other reason except Yankee restlessness and
craving, turned his thoughts in a similar
direction. On discovering to each other their
mutual proclivities, the friends determined to
set out together, as soon as Edward could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
gain his mother's consent, for the Territory
of Minnesota. With characteristic nobleness
and fortitude, Mrs. Sherman sacrificed her
her own to her son's wishes, and it was not
until the morning of his departure, that her
courage faltered.</p>

<p>Mother-like she sat at the head of the
table, unable to swallow a mouthful herself,
while urging every delicacy upon her darling
son.</p>

<p>"Do, dear Edward, have another cup of
coffee," she pleaded, observing that his cup
was empty, while his breakfast remained untasted.</p>

<p>"Well, just to accommodate," said Edward
smiling. "I really have not much appetite
this morning."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you can relish it, Mr. Edward,"
said Recta, in a whining tone. "It's seasoned
with old Spot's cream, and I'm thinking it
will be a long time before you'll taste any
more tame milk, out there among them wild
cattle."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>At this remark, the great square dining-room
rang with the laughter of the younger
occupants of the old-fashioned straight backed
chairs,&mdash;this being the only room in the house,
to which the progressive spirit had not yet
extended, except, indeed, that which was
manifested in the cut glass decanters, standing
<i>empty</i> on the handsome sideboard.</p>

<p>A deep convulsive sob broke from Mrs.
Sherman, and the merriment instantly ceased.
The mother leaned forward and covering her
face with her hands, gave vent to her long
suppressed feelings. Edward was by her side
in an instant, and throwing his arms around
her neck, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Mother, I will not leave you!"</p>

<p>"Then I can't go alone," whispered George
Goodrich to Louise.</p>

<p>"Ma," said Louise, "Dr. Goodrich says he
will stay, too."</p>

<p>"No, not quite that," said the embarrassed
lover.</p>

<p>"O, you must both go," interrupted Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Sherman, recovering with an effort her presence
of mind; "and we are wasting precious
time," she continued, pointing to the clock,
with returning firmness.</p>

<p>The old clock which occupied one corner
in seven feet grandeur, would as soon have
thought of stopping to indulge in sighs and
tears, as would Mrs. Sherman, when her
spirit was moved to the necessity for action.
So, all the scruples of her son were peremptorily
shut out of existence, and Recta,
frowned into silence, withheld the probe,
which, having fallen into the common error,
she had mistaken for the healing salve.</p>

<p>In passing briefly over the season of parting,
there is an item which should claim
special attention for a moment, as it is intimately
connected with the destination of our
adventurers.</p>

<p>As Edward stood by the family carriage,
which was to transport them to the public
conveyance, while waiting for his friend, who
had appropriated to himself a private moment
with Louise, Mrs. Sherman inquired rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
anxiously, "Edward, have you that letter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother," and, more to fill up an unpleasant
gap of time than to prove his veracity,
he produced from his pocket the missive.
It was superscribed, "Dr. DeWolf,
Chimney Rock, Minnesota Territory."</p>

<p>Prompted by the same motive which had
actuated the other, Mrs. Sherman repeated
some of her previous instructions.</p>

<p>"Now, Edward, when you arrive at Penddleton,
by all means make an immediate
effort to discover the whereabouts of Dr. DeWolf.
I should much like to hear from your
father's early friend. I think he states, in
the only letter we have ever received from
him, that he has fixed his home at Chimney
Rock, in the vicinity of Pendleton. However,
he may have removed from there by
this time, although he was not of a roving
disposition. The persuasions of an affectionate
wife, who saw with anxiety, her husband's
growing love for the wine cup, induced him
to emigrate to the far West. In breaking
away from the associations which led him to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
form the habit, she hoped he might attain
that rank in his profession, which his brilliant
youth had promised. Edward," and here
Mrs. Sherman's voice sank to a whisper,
"your father was saved about that time. It
was by signing the Washingtonian Temperance
Pledge. Be warned, my son, and flee
the temptation which had well nigh stigmatized
you as a drunkard's son. I have always
intended to tell you this, but the subject was
too harrowing. I could not do it."</p>

<p>"You might have saved yourself the pain,
now, mother," said Edward proudly; "There
is no danger of <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>That positive declaration came from just
such a son, as many a widowed mother and
affectionate sister have doted on. Generous,
warm-hearted, and strikingly handsome, Edward
Sherman, appeared a perfect type of
manhood. Were it not that the noblest forms
have sometimes hid blemished souls the world
had not so often been baptized in tears.</p>

<p>The lovers were now at hand. Time had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
flown with them on a "dove's wings," and its
flutterings lightened their last adieu.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap"> journey of a few days brought
our travellers to the lively, bustling
village, which for convenience we have
named Pendleton, situated on the Upper Mississippi.
After several hours of rest and refreshment
at their hotel, they sallied out to
enjoy a pedestrian excursion in the cool of
the day. Not much of the place of their sojourn
was visible. Gaslight, had not wandered
so far from its birthplace. The enterprising
inhabitants, however, had manufac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>tured
an article by the same name, but it was
never known to generate light. The wagging
of the machinery was all that came of it.</p>

<p>"Lager Beer," pronounced Edward Sherman,
glancing at the gilt letters, that stood
out in bold relief on the illumined window of
a fashionable saloon, which they were at the
moment passing.</p>

<p>"Yes, lager beer," repeated George Goodrich,
musingly. "Ned, what a nation of
beer drinkers we are becoming. Not at the
east only, but these western towns seem to
have a beer saloon at every corner."</p>

<p>"Well, Doctor, what is more harmless than
beer? Come, let us turn back and take a
glass;" and suiting the action to the word, Edward
had passed behind the screen which
shaded the entrance, before the expostulations
of his companion, who followed mechanically,
could reach his ear.</p>

<p>While Edward was leisurely sipping his
lager, the loud and angry voices of a party
of young men, who were in the act of leav<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>ing
an adjoining apartment, used as a billiard
saloon, attracted his attention. As a lady
proved to be the cause of the altercation, we
will do them the justice to state that they were
decidedly under the influence of stimulants,
One of their number, less insane than his
companions, was endeavoring to quell the
disturbance.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, "the name of a
lady, whom we all respect should not be used
too freely."</p>

<p>"Just so," chimed in another, "I say, let
the matter rest."</p>

<p>"The hatchet is buried. Peace, peace, to
Dr. DeWolf and his lovely daughter, forever,"
sang out the third.</p>

<p>The name and place, introduced in the
quarrel, quite satisfied Edward that the
daughter of his father's friend was the subject
of the altercation.</p>

<p>"I've had a revelation to-night, George,"
said Edward, when they were again in the
street.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then your eyes were opened, and you
saw the handwriting on the wall, did you?
Pity, those poor fools we left behind, could
not borrow your optics."</p>

<p>"Ah, Doctor, you're on the wrong track.
It has been revealed to me, that Dr. DeWolf
has a lovely daughter, and&mdash;come, now, don't
interrupt me with your old-fashioned, worn-out
temperance hobby&mdash;as I was about to
say, I have in my possession a letter of introtion
to said DeWolf. He was formerly a
friend of father's, and, of course, it will be
my duty to cultivate his acquaintance and
that of his lovely daughter, as early as possible,&mdash;say
to-morrow. What say you, friend
sober-sides? You know, my particular weakness
is a lovely lady."</p>

<p>"Why, it's no affair of mine, Ned. Flirting
is out of my line. But, how do you
know the lady is lovely?"</p>

<p>"Why, was it not revealed to me, through
the imprudence of a whole bevy of her admirers."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, but, Ned, the ravings of a set of
drunken rowdies is not conclusive evidence."</p>

<p>"True," said Edward more seriously, "but,"
smiling again, "it's a young lady, anyhow,
and I hope she is handsome."</p>

<p>Nothing further was said on the subject
that evening, but, on the day following,
young Sherman was informed by the landlord,
of whom he inquired, that Dr. DeWolf resided
at Chimney Rock, about five miles distant,
and to the question, "Has he a family?"
replied, "But one daughter, a beauty of
some celebrity."</p>

<p>The informant observed the gratified
twinkle in the eye of his guest and was not
surprised when Edward ordered a carriage to
be in readiness for him directly after dinner.</p>

<p>"The road is precipitous in some places,
and horseback riding is considered safer,"
suggested the landlord.</p>

<p>"Well, two saddle horses, then," replied
the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly, at the time above specified,
our adventurers, each mounted on a dapple
gray, set out for Chimney Rock. The scorching
sun, and dusty streets, and poor little
withered flowers by the wayside, prodigals
from the adjoining valley, were soon exchanged
for the "Valley Road," fringed with
the loveliest specimens of the floral family,
and cooled by the shade of the surrounding
bluffs. Like all other things in life, this part
of their journey was of short duration.</p>

<p>"Half a mile on this road," said Edward,
reining in his steed, and repeating previous
instructions, "brings us to the 'Siamese Twins'
a double bluff singularly joined towards the
top by the projection of an enormous rock.
Now, we are here, and no mistake, then turn
to the right."</p>

<p>"And keep the road as best we may,"
said Dr. Goodrich, raising his hat, and wiping
the perspiration from his brow. "Well,
come on."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>They went on, on and on, over rocks and
ledges and fallen trees; fording streams and
climbing heights (for they had lost their way)
until the lengthened twilight, attendant on
the summer evenings of Minnesota, began to
darken into night.</p>

<p>At this junction, when it may be readily
imagined that Edward Sherman's ardor had
somewhat cooled, and the emotions of his
fellow traveller were not of the most agreeable
nature, alternate snatches of song-singing
and whistling were heard, not far distant.
The bewildered parties rode hastily forward,
and met the musician.</p>

<p>"Can you tell how far we are from Chimney
Rock, my friend? We have lost our
way," said Edward frankly.</p>

<p>"Why no, you ain't lost your way neither,"
replied the stranger roughly. "You
are there, now. Just ride round the 'tother
side of this bluff, and you'll see all there is
of it."</p>

<p>"Well, can you inform me where Dr. DeWolf
lives?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess I can. Keep right straight
ahead, when you get the 'tother side of the
Pass, there. That road takes you down to
Hog Run, and the Run takes you to Beer
Holler, and the brewery is right in the Holler,
and 'tother side of that, on the hill, is Dr.
DeWolf's."</p>

<p>"What a huddle of euphonious names,"
exclaimed the Doctor, after having proffered
a "Thank you, sir," to the individual who
had so opportunely appeared. "Beer Hollow
will be just suited to your mind, Ned. In
that romantic spot, inhaling the perfume of
your favorite beverage, love making will be
doubly intoxicating."</p>

<p>"Hush, Doctor, eavesdroppers ahead,"
said Edward, pointing towards the Pass.</p>

<p>Now, the Pass was nothing more than a
narrow strip of table land, serving as a passage
way between the Mississippi River, and
a towering bluff. The view of the river was
here intercepted by a thick grove of trees
and shrubbery, which our horsemen had already
entered. They did not, therefore, see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the tiny green skiff, with its sprinkling of
white letters on the bow, christening it "Comet,"
shoot ahead, and dart into the little cove
near by, one of the most romantic and cosy
of those emerald-hung parlors opening from
the grand reception hall, of the "Father of
Waters." Neither did they see the fair occupant
rise on tip-toe, and peep mischieveously,
through the festooned loopholes of the forest.</p>

<p>But they saw the dark objects to which
the last speaker had called attention, partially
concealed by the trees. The beast on
which Edward was mounted stopped suddenly,
shivering, apparently with fear. Instantaneously,
two dark figures darted from
their lurking places, and, in low gutteral tones
demanded money. Unarmed, and completely
in the power of the ruffians, who each, pistol
in hand, held firmly by bit and bridle, the
horse of his victim, the part of wisdom,
seemed to be to surrender.</p>

<p>At that instant, a slight figure glided from
the thicket behind the waylayers, and cau<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>tiously
drawing forth a revolver which projected
from the belt of the nearest, placed
the muzzle at his back and fired. He fell
with a deep groan. Another discharge followed
quickly, and his companion reeled
several yards, seizing convulsively trees and
shrubbery, and finally, was heard sliding
down the bank towards the river.</p>

<p>"Now, ride for your lives, there's more of
them," said their deliverer, in a voice husky
with excitement.</p>

<p>"What will you do?" said Edward.</p>

<p>"Take my skiff."</p>

<p>"No, mount here, quick," and he drew her
up, and set off at full speed.</p>

<p>"Now, turn here, now up that hill; now
we are there," the lady faintly articulated, as
they flew along, and drew up before her
father's door.</p>

<p>The house at which they had arrived, was
the residence of Dr. DeWolf, and the heroine
of the adventure, was no other than the
Doctor's only daughter, quaintly named, Lit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>tle
Wolf. She had been, as was her wont,
on a short independent trip up the river. In
the full enjoyment of the romantic scenery
and twilight hour, night had stolen upon her
unawares. Warned of her imprudence by
the distant clatter of horses, she immediately
turned homeward. The swift current aided
her efforts, and she neared the Pass, just in
time to overhear all that was said. Not satisfied
with the dim outline of objects, which
a peep through the leaves disclosed, she
sprang to the shore, and catching by the
branch of an overhanging tree, drew herself
up the steep bank. The part which she performed
in the perilous encounter is already
known to the reader, but the leading motives
which prompted it, will be better understood
hereafter.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap"> shout from the fugitives brought
several faces to the window, and from
the door hobbled an old man. He
cautiously peered into the gloom, and finally
at the sound of a familliar voice sidled up to
Edward and his charge.</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, what's the matter?"
said he.</p>

<p>"It's me, help me down, daddy, do, I'm
tired," said Little Wolf, in feeble tones.</p>

<p>"O, lamb, O, honey, O, pet, is it you?" ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>claimed
the old dotard, trembling with apprehension.
"'Tween you and me, what has
happened to the darling?"</p>

<p>"O, nothing, daddy, only I saw Bloody
Jim, and I'm afraid there's more of them."</p>

<p>"O, my Lord, did you? O, my Lord, the
men are down to the brewery. O, my,
'tween you and me, what <i>shall</i> we do?"</p>

<p>Perceiving the old man's utter incapacity
to the exigency, Edward threw his rein to
the Doctor, and immediately bore the young
lady into the house. The old man followed,
grasping his arm, and shouting in his ear at
every step, "'Tween you and me, she saw
Bloody Jim, did she&mdash;she saw him&mdash;did
she&mdash;ha!"</p>

<p>"In the ante-room, they were met by a
little bustling elderly woman, in cap and
spectacles. "O, daddy, what is it?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"O, mammy," he cried, releasing Edward,
and laying hold on his wife,&mdash;a method by
which he invaribly compelled attention,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
"'tween you and me, she's seen Bloody Jim
she has; she says there's more of them, she
does."</p>

<p>"Why, you, old fool, why don't you do
something?" said the woman, shaking him
off with a jerk. "Lock the doors, shut the
windows, call Sorrel Top; blow the horn. Is
the love hurt?" turning anxiously to Little
Wolf, who was reclining on the sofa.</p>

<p>Mammy had hastily snatched up the small
lamp, with which the apartment was dimly
lighted, and, as she was scrutinizing her pet,
Edward obtained a full view of the young
lady's features. He gave a sudden start, and
the blood rushed to his face. Was it the
lady he had so frequently seen on Broadway,
a few months since? he asked himself. Yes,
the very same; that countenance was not
easily forgotten. Why, she was a New York
belle, was his first reflection. Our heroine's
voice was still low and agitated as she replied,
"O, no, mammy, not hurt, only frightened.
You attend to the gentlemen and the house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
I can take care of myself. I feel better
now."</p>

<p>"Well, then, rest here, love; you look
pale. Now don't move; don't get excited;
nobody shall hurt the pet, I'll tell Sorrel
Top to bring you a glass of water."</p>

<p>Amidst the slamming of doors and rattling
of windows, mammy was heard calling at
the top of her voice, "Sorrel Top, Sorrel,
take a glass of water to the parlor;" and to
the parlor hastened Sorrel Top. But meeting
daddy at the door, she was forcibly detained,
and subjected to his deafening vociferations,
rendered doubly aggravating, by his
using the ear of his auditor as one would a
speaking trumpet. The burden of his song,
was still "Bloody Jim, Bloody Jim!"</p>

<p>"Who cares for Bloody Jim;" said Sorrel
Top angrily; "I don't care for him, nor none
of his tribe. Let me go, you, torment."</p>

<p>Daddy held his ground, for he bore in
mind firstly: that Sorrel Top was his fellow
servant; secondly, she possessed no great
strength of muscle or nerve, and, thirdly and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
lastly, that she was a helpless widow, whom
it was no sin to call Sorrel Top, because of
her enormous growth of reddish hair.</p>

<p>Edward stepped forward to relieve Sorrel
Top of the glass of water, which she was
holding at arm's length, and at the same
time suggested that a little brandy might be
beneficial to the lady.</p>

<p>"Brandy! Brandy! did you say?" sounded
in his ear like a knell, and he was caught in
the old man's trap. "Laws! young man,
she'd as soon drink a rattle snake; she's
down on brandy; she's down on the hull of
that infarnel stuff. Spirits of every kind is
her abhorrence.</p>

<p>The Doctor was highly amused at his
friend's predicament, and, giving him a sly
wink, remarked, "Beer will do as well, Ned,
and it is perfectly harmless, you know."</p>

<p>The Doctor's turn had come, In a still
higher stage of excitment, daddy pounced upon
him. "Young man," he thundered, "beer
harmless? 'tween you and me, lager beer is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the devil's pison, slow but sure. Don't you
believe me?"</p>

<p>"Coax him away, Sorrel Top," said Little
Wolf, rousing herself.</p>

<p>"Come, daddy, Miss DeWolf wants us to
be off, she says so," said Sorrel Top, resolutely
approaching him.</p>

<p>"Me go! O, no, 'tween you an' me, I
must stay and protect the love." The Doctor
was instantly released. His assailant had
embarked in a new enterprise. But Sorrel
Top was firm.</p>

<p>"What good are you doing, I should like
to know," she said.</p>

<p>"What good be you a doing, you, hussy?"
reiterated daddy; don't you hear mammy
blowing the horn; 'tween me an' you, she's
short winded. I'll protect the pet."</p>

<p>"Never mind me, daddy," said the young
mistress, now quite revived; "if you ain't
afraid, you had better assist mammy."</p>

<p>She had touched her would-be-protector in
a sensitive spot, and he vehemently ejaculated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
"me afraid; not I. 'Tween you and me,
what should I be afraid of, I would like to
know?"</p>

<p>"Why, of Bloody Jim."</p>

<p>The old man glanced dubiously towards
the door, and slid out.</p>

<p>Edward eagerly seized the propitious
moment to formerly introduce himself and
companion, to their fair preserver. Mutual
explanation followed, and Little Wolf cordially
welcomed our friends to Chimney Rock.
"Father is at the brewery," she said, "he'll
be in directly; the horn is our alarm bell."</p>

<p>"Is there any further danger to be apprehended?"
said Edward; "I think you killed
them both."</p>

<p>Little Wolf suddenly changed countenance.</p>

<p>Her beautiful, bewitching face had been
half hidden by curls, and covered with
blushes, from the moment her faintness had
passed off, and, but for the twinkle of those
mischief-loving brown eyes, and certain unmistakable
movements of her slight figure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
she might have passed for meekness itself.
To those, therefore, who were unacquainted
with her peculiarly nervous and impulsive
temperament, the change in her apperance
was rather surprising. With one sweep of
her plump little hand, she tossed back the
ringlets from her brow, and frowningly declared
she wished she had killed them. "I
didn't kill them, though," she said, "or, at
all events, I killed but one; the other,
Bloody Jim, he's called, I cannot kill. I've
tried it before. He's my evil genius. He
carried me off bodily, once, just before I
went away to school."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Edward, deeply interested,
"how did you escape?"</p>

<p>"O, a gentleman rescued me."</p>

<p>Edward said "indeed" again, but his tone
was <i>slightly</i> changed. He did not feel <i>quite</i>
as comfortable, as he had a moment before;
but in the unpleasant scene which immediately
followed, his chagrin passed unnoticed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>The sound of the horn, had brought to the
house, all the loungers at the brewery who
were in a condition to render aid, and some
who were not. Among the last named was
Dr. DeWolf, who staggered to the parlor, and
boisterously demanded, "What's all this fuss
about?"</p>

<p>He was in the first stage of drunkenness,
and consequently more difficult to manage
than he would have been an hour or two
later, when he was usually brought home in
a helpless condition.</p>

<p>Little Wolf made a desperate struggle to
appear composed.</p>

<p>"O, nothing," she replied with the slightest
possible quiver in her voice, "I saw Bloody
Jim, that's all."</p>

<p>"That's enough," murmured the parent,
sinking into a chair. The very mention of
that name seemed to have completely sobered
him. For, bloated and inebriated though he
was, paternal love still lived, a green spot in
the waste, which alcoholic fires had not yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
burned out. He sat for a moment in silence,
pressing his hand to his brow, and then, without
appearing to notice his guests, abruptly
left the room.</p>

<p>His daughter hastily excused herself, and
followed him. Once outside the door, she
drew a long breath, but shill choking down
her mortified feelings, she bounded across
the adjoining room, and meeting mammy,
paused to give a few necessary orders.</p>

<p>"O, laws, honey," objected mammy, "I can't
do nothing, and I can't get nobody else to do
nothing. O, laws, honey, what if Bloody
Jim should come? the men are half of 'em
drunk; we'll all go to destruction together."</p>

<p>"O, fudge, mammy, Bloody Jim is shot;
there's no danger. Come, now, you do as I
tell you. I <i>must</i> go to my room a minute."
and she flew into the hall and up the long
staircase, as if she had wings, leaving mammy
muttering to herself.</p>

<p>"Poor motherless child; sich as this is
enough to make the honey stiddy; dear me,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
there's no stiddying her&mdash;clean gone mad, I
declare.</p>

<img src="images/capQ.jpg" width="110" height="160" alt="Q" title="Q" />
</div><p class="dropcap">uite like a little fury, Little Wolf
burst into her own private apartment.
Locking the door, she stopped suddenly
and stamped, in a paroxism of grief and
vexation.</p>

<p>"A drunkard's child!" she said scornfully
"Disgrace!&mdash;I hate everybody!&mdash;I wish I'd
shot myself!&mdash;I wish I was dead!&mdash;I wish
father&mdash;" she did not finish the sentence; a
loud knock at the door interrupted her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who's there?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Me," said Sorrel Top.</p>

<p>"Go away," said her young mistress, imperatively.</p>

<p>"Mammy sent me," said Sorrel Top, "the
Doctor is dying."</p>

<p>"O, God!" exclaimed Little Wolf, in an
agony, "I have got my wish."</p>

<p>Trembling violently, she descended to the
parlor and found her father stretched out on
the sofa in an apoplectic fit. Wild and reckless
as her words had been, Little Wolf
would not for the world have seen her wishes
fulfilled, and she was spared the remorse,
which under the peculiar circumstances, her
father's death would have occasioned.</p>

<p>Not having perceived how completely her
information respecting Bloody Jim, had
brought her father to his senses, she little
dreamed that, while she was giving orders to
mammy, he was in another part of the house
inspecting the fastenings of the doors and
shutters. Finding all secure, he returned to
the parlor, in order to learn the particulars of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
her meeting with the being, whose very name
had created such terror and dismay throughout
the household. Observing young Sherman
and Dr. Goodrich, he attempted to
address them, but suddenly lost the power of
speech.</p>

<p>It was many hours before Dr. Goodrich
dared give any encouragement of his recovery
to his almost distracted daughter. All night
long, she watched, with the young physician
and Edward, by his bedside.</p>

<p>Daddy and others, kept a bright look out
for the enemy; but he had been too badly
wounded, to attempt any further violence
that night.</p>

<p>For reasons unknown to any except the
parties concerned, Dr. DeWolf had, in the
person of Bloody Jim, a revengeful and
deadly enemy. He belonged to the Red
River half-breeds. Several years before,
while a company of his people were encamped
in the vicinity of St. Paul, on the upper Mississippi,
for the purpose of trafficking with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the whites, Dr. DeWolf had paid them a
chance visit.</p>

<p>As some alleviation to the insupportable
loneliness, which the recent death of his wife
occasioned, he accepted the invitation, of his
friend and financial adviser, Squire Tinknor,
to spend a few weeks with him, in the place
above mentioned. This friend, was unfortunately,
for a man of the Doctor's irregular
habits, wealthy, wild and dissipated. Together
they sought out and visited every
place of amusement. Returning in company,
from a horse race, one pleasant afternoon,
they came in sight of the tented village,
occupied by this demi-savage people.
The novelty attracted the Doctor's attention
and he insisted on alighting. "I must see
what they've got in there," he said, pointing
towards a tent from which the sound of music
was heard.</p>

<p>Peeping slyly through a crack in the canvas,
he saw the music-maker, a young girl,
carelessly drawing a bow across the strings of
a dilapitated violin, while her own very sweet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
voice, dropped out a gay stanza, in broken
English. She was alone; so the Doctor
boldly lifted the door and went in. Five,
ten and fifteen minutes, his companion impatiently
awaited his appearance, and at length,
seriously disturbed at his absence, he shouted
his name.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the Doctor from within,
"I'm coming."</p>

<p>"What detained you so deuced long,"
said his friend, when they were again on
their way.</p>

<p>"O, playing the agreeable to a little fool,
who was sawing away on a greasy fiddle,"
said the recent widower of forty-five, or
more. He was careful not to mention that
the "little fool," was beautifully formed,
with ruddy checks, with dark, loving eyes
and, being rather handsome himself, he
had conceived the idea of captivating her
silly heart. The story of the "Spider and
the fly," fitly illustrates the means by which
his purpose was afterwards accomplished.</p>

<p>His inamorata had innocently informed him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
that her protector, "brother Jim," spent the
most of his time in the city, and the Doctor
soon discovered that her savage looking relative
frequently drank to excess. Under such
favorable circumstances it required but little
management to elude his vigilance. But,
after the mischief was done, it was not so
easy to escape a brother's revenge; especially
as that brother's naturally ferocious nature
had already acquired him the title of "Bloody
Jim."</p>

<p>Not many months after the Doctor had
returned home, his punishment began. He
had just gone to the brewery to spend the
evening, when his little daughter came running
in.</p>

<p>"O, papa," she exclaimed, panting for
breath, "I met such a great tall man out
here&mdash;he wasn't an Injin&mdash;he talked a little
like one, though. He had on a blue coat
with bright buttons, and he had such <i>awful</i>
eyes; O, dear!"</p>

<p>"What did he say, daughter?" said the
Doctor, catching up his child, and pressing
her to his heart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, he said, 'what name?' I told him papa
always called me daughter, mamma used to
call me Little Wolf, and daddy and mammy
called me honey, pet, dove, love, and <i>every
thing</i>, I wish I had a regular name, papa&mdash;I
mean to give orders to be called Little Wolf,
for mamma knew best, and she called me so."</p>

<p>"Little Wolf it shall be," said obedient
papa. "But what next did the man say?"</p>

<p>"O, he said 'papa's name.' I said Dr. DeWolf;
than he made such a coarse noise in
his throat, just like an Injin; I thought he
wanted to get me, so I ran in here, quick."</p>

<p>Dr. DeWolf groaned in bitterness of spirit.
He thought of Bloody Jim, and was tortured
with vague fears of what might be. He did
not spend that evening in drinking at the
brewery. But it was the last night his child
knew a father's care. After that, he did
nothing but drink, drink. He had drank
before, in spite of the pleadings of his wife,
whom his conduct had brought to a premature
grave, and, as trouble increased, he
drank yet the more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>From the moment Bloody Jim saw the
Doctor's beautiful child, he worked to gain
possession of her and spared her father's life
for a time. In pursuance of his plans he returned
to the Red River country and gathered
about him a set of lawless wretches,
whom he had before led on to deeds of violence,
and brought them to Chimney Rock.
The gang secreted themselves among the
towering bluffs in the vicinity, and, while
watching for their prey, robbed all who came
in their way. The frequent outrages committed
on travellers, spread alarm throughout
the surrounding country, and officers of justice
were dispatched in search of the perpetrators.
In this state of affairs, Bloody Jim,
resolved at once to make a bold attempt to
capture the coveted prize, and quit the
country. Selecting for his purpose, the hour
when the Doctor was in the habit of leaving
home for the brewery, he lurked in ambush,
until Little Wolf, who usually accompanied
her father the most of the way, should return
home alone, and, when the opportunity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
came, seized suddenly upon her, and, in spite
of her struggles, bore her away towards the
river. Leaping into a canoe, he threatened
her with instant death, if she made the
slightest resistance, and pushed out for the
opposite shore. It was quite dusk when
they landed on the other side. The poor
frightened child, now for the first time broke
the silence. She begged to be taken home
again; but her captor only laughed horribly.
"I Bloody Jim," said he; "how you like to
be my wife?"</p>

<p>"O, take me home, I'm only a little girl,"
pleaded Little Wolf with quivering lip.</p>

<p>"You be big, by and by."</p>

<p>As he said this, an unseen hand laid him
senseless on the beach. The same individual
who dealt the blow, returned the child safely
to her home, and leaving her to tell her own
story, disappeared.</p>

<p>A chill of horror crept over the Doctor,
when mammy, the next morning, related to
him, her pet's adventure. He wrote immediately
to his friend, Squire Tinknor, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
advice. "Send the child away to boarding
school," was the counsel given, and forthwith,
the Doctor acted upon it.</p>

<p>Four years at school, and a winter of fashionable
life in New York, transformed the
little miss into an accomplished young lady.</p>

<p>When about to return home, she purchased
a superb brace of pistols. At her request,
Mr. Marston, the brother of the young lady
whose hospitality she had shared, selected
them for her. As he was one of those quiet,
fatherly sort of young men, who naturally
win the confidence, if not the love, of young
ladies, she felt no hesitancy in opening her
heart to him, on the subject of the pistols.
She also related to him the story of her wonderful
escape from Bloody Jim, and positively
declared that if he ever came near her again,
she intended to shoot him through the heart.</p>

<p>"But how would you reward the person
who rescued you," said Mr. Marston, eagerly.</p>

<p>"O, I'd do anything in the world for him,"
she replied, "if I only knew who he was."</p>

<p>"Would you love him?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I'd love him."</p>

<p>Just then the peculiar expression of her
sober friend's face startled her, and she
added, with one of her merry laughs, "provided
he was not a poky old bachelor."</p>

<p>The bachelor perceiving that his time had
not yet come, allowed the little would-be
Amazon to depart, without again making the
slightest approach to the subject nearest his
heart.</p>

<p>Her skill in the use of the silver-mounted
weapons, excited great admiration in the
breast of daddy, whom she usually allowed
to assist in setting up a target, because she
could not well get rid of him. His eulogies
were, on the whole, rather gratifying to her
vanity, for before his sight failed him, he had
been no mean marksman.</p>

<p>Entirely unconscious of the dangerous resistance
to be met, Bloody Jim made his
second attempt on Little Wolf's freedom.
She was returning from a long tedious walk,
among the bluffs, at the close of a Spring
day; her revolvers hid away in the holders,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
beneath her mantle, when suddenly, her
enemy appeared in her path. Little Wolf
stood for a moment as if spell-bound. Again
she heard that horrid guttural laugh and saw
those fiendish black eyes. "I got you now,"
was all he had time to say, before a ball from
her pistol pierced him. She saw him fall,
and fled. As nothing more was heard from
him, or his men, it was generally supposed
that Little Wolf had put an end to his life.</p>

<p>Like one risen from the dead, he appeared
to her in his attack upon Dr. Goodrich and
Edward Sherman, at the Pass. She knew he
must have gone there to watch for her, and
in saving others, she had also saved herself.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">orning dawned fresh and beautiful.
Dr. DeWolf's symptoms continued
favorable. Refreshed and
re-invigorated, after an hour's repose, the
watchers gathered around the breakfast table
with cheerful faces. Too young and mirthful
to be very seriously affected, for any
great length of time, by what had occured,
Little Wolf joined with her guests in sipping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
coffee, and talking over the events of the
preceeding evening with becoming composure.</p>

<p>During the meal, she slipped out to peep
into the invalid's apartment. As she flitted
from the room, the Doctor turned to Edward,
who was gazing after her with an expression
of intense admiration. "Ah, Ned," said he
"your time has come."</p>

<p>"Fact, Doctor, I do feel queer. The little
witch is too much for me."</p>

<p>"What can I do for you?" said the Doctor,
with a professional nod.</p>

<p>"O, leave me here to-day, Doctor. Positively,
I can't go back with you."</p>

<p>"What, Ned, allow me to fight my way
alone, through a band of desperadoes?" said
the Doctor, with feigned trepidation.</p>

<p>"Pshaw, Doctor! there's no danger; their
chief is dead, or wounded, and they've fled
long before this time."</p>

<p>Their young hostess broke in upon the
conference with a smiling face. "Papa is
resting very quietly," she said; "but I fear
a return of his complaint. I shall feel anx<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>ious
'till you return, Doctor, if indeed, you
still think you must go back this morning.
Could not Mr. Sherman go for you? Daddy
might show him the way."</p>

<p>Edward cast an imploring look towards
the Doctor, who magnanimously sacrificed
his own ease to the wishes of his friend.
"It will be necessary, for me to go myself,"
he replied; "but give yourself no uneaseiness,
Miss DeWolf. I do not think your
father will have a second attack. I will
accept your offer of a guide, and, with your
permission will leave my friend, Mr. Sherman,
as my proxy."</p>

<p>There was a slight dash of malice in the
Doctor's last words, which Edward was too
grateful to notice.</p>

<p>When the hour for setting out arrived,
daddy appeared, armed and equipped, for
what his fears had magnified into an exceedingly
perilous journey. At sight him, of Little
Wolf burst into an uncontrollable fit of
laughter. His little, insignificant figure was
girded by an old leathern belt, which was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
literally stuck full, of such weapons as he
could hastily pick up, about the premises.</p>

<p>"Bless me! what do you expect to do with
that outlandish outfit?" said his young mistress,
when she was able to speak.</p>

<p>"Why 'fend myself, to be sure," replied
the old man indignantly.</p>

<p>"O, fie, daddy," said she coaxingly; take
off that heavy old belt. Why it makes you
look so, and sweat so, too. Come, now, if
you will, I'll lend you one of my pistols."</p>

<p>The old man's rising temper was quite
mollified, at the proposal of Little Wolf; for
to sport those pistols, had been an honor, to
which he had hitherto aspired in vain.</p>

<p>"Well, now, I'll explain the case, honey,"
said he, attempting to approach her; "'tween
you and me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, no, no," said Little Wolf, putting her
fingers to her ears, and slipping our of his
way.</p>

<p>"Bless her heart," said daddy, turning to
the Doctor; "that's just the way she used to
run away from me, when she was a little gal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
'Tween you and me, though, I was only going
to tell her, how it wasn't the heft of this
ere belt, that made me sweat so. It was
sharpening these ere, on the old grindstone,"
and he drew forth a couple of large butcher
knives, which glistened brightly in the sunbeams.</p>

<p>"O, those knives are just what mammy
wants in the kitchen; I heard her say so,"
said Little Wolf appearing on the piazza
with the pistols.</p>

<p>It required a vast amount of coaxing to
bring the old man to terms, but finally a compromise
was effected, and stowing a knife
away in his coat pocket, he set out with one
of the pistols, the Doctor being armed with
the other.</p>

<p>Instead of the short cut of the night before,
the Doctor chose the more circuitous
route through the village; if a cluster of
dilapidated houses might be dignified by that
name. Dr. DeWolf's old brown residence,
situated on a high hill, with its piazza stretching
across the front, was the most imposing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
edifice to be seen. The remaining comfortless
dwellings, mostly log cabins, and board
shanties, with their broken windows and ragged
inmates, who flocked out to gaze at the
strangers, presented an appearance desolate
in the extreme. Even the shadow cast by
old Chimney Rock, after which the place was
named, added a darker aspect to the scene.
Chinmey Rock was an irregular old bluff,
standing like a grim old castle by the riverside,
its chimney-like summit, rocky and bare,
the most conspicuous object in the landscape.</p>

<p>"What a God-forsaken place," exclaimed
the doctor, involuntarily.</p>

<p>"'Tis so, this ere is a broke-down, one-horse
concern, and that ain't the wust on't,
nuther," said his companion; who was almost
bursting with communicativeness.</p>

<p>"Well, what is the worst of it?" inquired
the Doctor, as much to gratify the old man's
weakness, as to satisfy his own curiosity.</p>

<p>"Why, Doctor, 'tween you an' me, there's
awful doin's here. Ye see, sence that saloon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
was sot up in one end of the old brewery, all
the men here have got to drinking, and 'tis
astonishing how men will act, when they git
soaked in liquor. I've heered temperance
lecturers tell stories that would make your
har stand on ind; that was when I was
young, and there was a great excitement on
the subject. I signed the pledge then, and I
never broke my word on no account, or I expect
I should be as bad as the rest of them
here. I've had to stand out agin hard persuasions.
They've tried to git me to take a
glass of lager; sez they, 'lager won't hurt
nobody;' sez I, 'it's hurt you.' You see, it
don't require no argument, I can pint 'em
to facts. Now, there's Prime Hawley; when
he come here to live, he was a fine, stiddy
young man; his wife was as pretty as a rose,
and as happy as a lark. Somehow, Prime
got to going to that saloon. Well, I gin him
fair waning. Sez I, 'Prime, they'll get the
halter on ye, if ye go there;' sez he 'I guess
not, a glass of lager won't hurt nobody;'
but now, sure as fate, he's the worst of 'em<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
all. He's whipped and frightened his putty
wife most to death, and she's got sickly now.
Some say he's even jined Bloody Jim's gang.
'Tween&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hark!" said the Doctor, suddenly interrupting
the narrator.</p>

<p>Deep, agonizing groans were distinctly
heard in the direction of the Pass, which they
were nearing.</p>

<p>"O, murder, what's that?" shouted
daddy; and he wheeled his horse about and
gallopped homeward.</p>

<p>"Stop, come back here," shouted the Doctor,
at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>The old man reluctantly obeyed. Approaching
within a short distance of the Doctor,
he motioned that individual towards him.
"O, Doctor, 'twont do fur to go furder,"
said he; "'tween you and me, I've heern
say, that's jist the way them robbers do,
when they want to ketch anybody. There
goes that yell agin. O, that ere <i>is</i> awful;
we'll get ketched; it won't do fur to stay
here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>Exasperated beyond endurance at the cowardice
of his guide, the Doctor bade him remain
where he was, while he went forward
to reconnoitre. A short ride round the point
of the bluff brought him directly upon the
bleeding form of the desperado, who had
attacked him the preceeding evening. Hailing
daddy, he alighted and approached the
apparently dying man.</p>

<p>"Prime Hawley, by gol!" exclaimed daddy,
as he came up. "Why, Prime," said he,
hopping briskly down from his saddle; "twixt
you and me, how did you get in this ere
fix?"</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" groaned Prime, "take me
home; I'm dying."</p>

<p>"I'll take him home if you say so, Doctor,"
said daddy, "his heft is nothing, and it's near
by."</p>

<p>"Very well, I'll follow with the horses."</p>

<p>"I say, Prime," said the old man, when
they had nearly reached the home of the
sufferer, "tween you and me, aint had nothin'
to do with Bloody Jim, have you!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I have; curse him!"</p>

<p>"He ain't nowhere 'bout here now, is
he?"</p>

<p>"I expect not, oh! oh! I wish he was suffering
as I am."</p>

<p>"O, Miss Hawley, 'tween you an' me,
here's a sore trial fur you," said daddy to a
pale-faced, delicate looking woman, who met
him at the cabin door with looks of alarm.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hawley trembled violently, and her
pale face grew a shade paler, but she asked
no questions, as she led the way to the bed.
Her silence, at first, impressed the Doctor
with the idea that she was accessory to her
husband's guilt, and he watched her closely.
No tear dimmed her eye, no sigh escaped
her, yet she seemed painfully alive to the
agony which her miserable husband endured,
while the Doctor was dressing his wound.</p>

<p>"Do you think he will live, Doctor?" she
enquired in a sort of hopeless, melancholy
tone, as Dr. Goodrich was about to leave.</p>

<p>"It is an exceedingly critical case," replied
the Doctor, "he may possibly recover."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tween you and me," said daddy, coming
between them, "I'd like to know how Prime
got that shot?"</p>

<p>Poor Prime shook his head imploringly
towards the Doctor, who went to him, and
quieted his apprehensions in a few whispered
words. "I don't care," said Prime, "only
it would kill her to know it."</p>

<p>As they were passing the old brewery,
when they were again on their way, a man
came out and accosted them. "Hello, old
Roarer," said he, addressing daddy, "how is
Dr. DeWolf, this morning"</p>

<p>The old man straightened himself in his
saddle, and preserved a dignified silence.</p>

<p>With an oath, the man commanded him to
speak, but daddy rode calmly on; his indignation
got the better of his cautiousness.</p>

<p>"I'll pound you to a jelly," shouted the man after him,</p>

<p>"I'll risk it," said daddy addressing the
Doctor.</p>

<p>Now daddy was not really a natural coward.
But it cannot be denied that old age<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
and extreme cautionsness had greatly moderated
the courage which he possessed in his
youth. "'Tween you and me," he continued,
"that Hank Glutter is the meanest critter
that ever trod shoe-leather. I've heern poor
Mrs. Hawley plead with him not to sell Prime
liquor, and I've heern him order her out of
the saloon, and I've follered her hum, to see
how she took it. Well, it was dreadful to
see her goings on. She'd bounce on to the
bed and groan there, then she'd bounce up
and throw herself on the floor and groan
there, and moan and holler right out; O, it
seemed 'zif she never would get cool. She'd
walk the floor, and wring her hands and take
on awful. Them was the times when she
was young and was full of grit&mdash;I've been
watching her lately, and she's acted rather
different. Ye see she was down to the
brewery night afore last, I seen her coming
hum and I knowed she was dreadful riled
about something, so I kept my eyes on her;
Lord! if she didn't drop, right down on her
knees afore her bed, and let off all her feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>ins
in a wonderful strange way. Seems 'zif
she just talked to the Lord. When she riz
up, she looked kinder quiet and resigned
like, just as she did to-day; sez I to myself,
if there's a God in heaven, he's heern that
woman. I expected he would send fire down
and burn that old brewery that very night,
but there it stands and that old cuss, that
hollered after me, is alive yet. 'Tween you
and me, them things is kinder strange, now
aint they, Doctor?"</p>

<p>"Rather strange," replied the Doctor
dryly.</p>

<p>After riding a few moments in silence,
daddy ventured to make still another attempt
to open a conversation. "'Tween you and
me, Doctor, was you acquainted with Miss
Sherman?"</p>

<p>"What Miss Sherman?" said the Doctor
in surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, young Edward's mother, down in
the old Bay State. I ain't heern nothin'
from the folks down thar since I left. I
seed young Edward didn't know me, but I've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
dandled him on my knee many a time, when
he was a leetle shaver. 'Tween you and me
there was a gal working at Judge Sherman's
that I had a liking fur, so Sundays, I used to
go down thar sparking, I'd kinder like to
know if that gal's spliced yet."</p>

<p>"What was her name?"</p>

<p>"Her name was Miss Orrecta Lippincott;
they generally called her Recta, in the
Judge's family."</p>

<p>"Recta is single yet, I saw her just before
we left; but why did'nt you marry her?"</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, Doctor, I was a fool,
I've allers felt a kinder hankering after her.
I can't get over them fust feelings I had, to
this ere day. Is she handsome yit, Doctor?"</p>

<p>"Not very."</p>

<p>"Well, I used to tell her if she got old
and grey, it wouldn't make no difference in
my feelins," said the old man, rubbing his
great, coarse hand across his eyes.</p>

<p>"'Tain't natur," he began after a moment's
pause, "to keep our feelings shet in allers.
Now, mammy is chuck full of spunk since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
she's married me, so I aint let on to nobody.
Ye see, if she got hold on't, she'd never give
me a minute's peace."</p>

<p>"Well, why didn't you marry Miss Lippincott?"</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, Doctor, I got it into
my head that she liked Sam Brown. Ye
see, there was a man told me that he seed
him and her kiss, right afore Judge Sherman's
gate. Wall, this feller was allers puttin' me
up to think that Orrecta was flirty like, and
I was jest fool enough to believe him, so I
jest packed up my duds and cum out West,
with Dr. DeWolf. He'd been teasing me to
cum 'long with him fur some time. Ye see,
I'd allers been his gardener, ever since he
was married. Miss DeWolf that's dead now,
she sot heaps by me. 'Now, Philip,' says
she&mdash;ye see my real name is Philip Roarer&mdash;'we
can't get 'long without you, fur to
milk the cow and make the garden'. I could
see that her eyes was a leetle watery like,
and I knew that she hated to cum off alone,
with the Doctor, 'cause sometimes when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
got a leetle tight, he didn't treat her nun too
well. But the Doctor got 'long fust rate,
when he fust got here; he didn't drink much
and he made heaps of money, he and a crony
of hisn, named Squire Tinknor. He lives in
St. Paul now, and does the Doctor's business
fur him yet. Ye see, Squire Tinknor can
drink a barrel of liquor and not feel it,
but the Doctor gets crazy enough, on
nothing but lager. 'Tween you an' me,
that old brewery in the holler has played
the devil with the Doctor. I told Hank
Glutter how it would be, when he fust
sot up the saloon in't. Sez I, 'Mr. Glutter,
I'd rather you'd chop this ere right hand of
mine right off, than to place that are temptation
afore Dr. DeWolf.' Sez he, 'What's the
harm of a leetle beer?' Sez I, 'Ain't you goin'
to sell nothin' else?' Sez he, 'O, I may
keep a few liquors jest for variety.' Seems
zif I should sink when he said that are, but I
jest felt zif I couldn't gin up, so I let right
into him. It didn't do no kinder good
though. Sez he, 'If I don't sell it somebody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
else will, and I might as will make money on
it as anybody.' Well, the long and short of
it is, Doctor, he has got rich on't and now,
'tween you and me, he's kinder hanging
'round the honey, but I guess he'll git his
walkin' papers afore long; ye see, the honey
she's alive, every inch on her."</p>

<img src="images/capS.jpg" width="100" height="160" alt="S" title="S" />
</div><p class="dropcap">wearing vengeance on daddy, who
had treated him with such unqualified
contempt, Hank Glutter entered his
saloon. He was a young man of about thirty
years of age, rather below medium height.
His form was well developed, his complexion
light, and his hair curled in luxuriant ringlets.
He was exceedingly vain of his appearance,
and, when in good humor, caressed his whiskers
incessantly. He was of a respectable
family and his education was liberal, and yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
he was nothing more than a smooth-tongued,
hard-hearted, revengeful villain.</p>

<p>He had aspired to Little Wolf's hand, but,
on making some unmistakable advances to
that lady, he was promptly repelled.</p>

<p>The supreme contempt with which she
invariably treated him exasperated him to
such a degree, that he conceived the diabolical
project of placing her in the power of
Bloody Jim, with whom he had already had
some secret dealings.</p>

<p>At his suggestion, Bloody Jim made overtures
to Prime Hawley to assist in the undertaking.
Prime, being in exceedingly indigent
circumstances, could not resist the tempting
reward offered.</p>

<p>The plan to capture Little Wolf, and convey
her across the river, in her own skiff, to
a point, where, having in mind his defeat on
a former occasion, he had stationed a guard,
was well laid, but miscarried, as we have
already seen.</p>

<p>Bloody Jim was but slightly wounded, and
he soon recovered sufficiently to seek a place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
of safety, leaving Prime Hawley, as he supposed,
dead.</p>

<p>Hank Glutter could gather no satisfactory
information from the intoxicated set, who that
night returned from Dr. DeWolf's, and, as
we have seen, daddy was disinclined to relieve
his suspense; therefore, he resolved to
go in person to the Doctor's, and ascertain, if
possible, the precise position of affairs.</p>

<p>By way of smoothing his ruffled plumes,
he hastily swallowed a stimulating draught,
and very soon a more complacent expression
settled upon his countenance.</p>

<p>Approaching a large mirror, he bestowed a
momentary attention upon his dress, but
lingered lovingly over his glossy ringlets.
"Miss DeWolf was a fool to turn the cold
shoulder to me," said he to himself, as he
gave the finishing touch to his soft flaxen
hair. "I wonder if Bloody Jim really got
her. If he has, wouldn't she be glad to fly
to my arms, though."</p>

<p>These comforting reflections were entirely
dispelled, when a few moments afterwards, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
was ushered into the parlor at Dr. DeWolf's,
and in utter astonishment, beheld Little Wolf
on apparently intimate terms with the handsome
stranger. She was holding an earnest
conversation with Edward concerning her
father, and did not at first notice the presence
of the intruder, who was, by this time,
heartily wishing himself behind his bar again.
But, contrary to his expectations, the young
lady granted him a gracious reception, and
introducing him to Mr. Sherman, almost immediately
excused herself to attend upon the
invalid.</p>

<p>The young men left alone entered into
conversation, and, so well did Hank Glutter
conceal his true character, that Edward was
quite well pleased with his appearance, and
at the close of the interview, accepted a
polite invitation to accompany Hank to his
saloon, and when there, was easily persuaded
to take a glass of lager beer. The day was
hot and the lager of the finest quality, so
before he left, he drank several glasses more,
and while thus engaged, confided to his en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>tertainer
the whole story of his adventure
with Bloody Jim.</p>

<p>"But what became of the men who were
shot," said Hank, burning with impatience to
learn the fate of his accomplices.</p>

<p>"O, we left the dead to bury their dead,
Mr. Glutter. Miss DeWolf is confident there
is a gang of the ruffians. I intend to make
it my business to look after them a little."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Hank, and as soon as Mr.
Sherman was gone, he proceeded to put his
dangerous threat into execution, by calling
upon Mrs. Hawley.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mrs. Hawley," said he in
his blandest tone, as she slowly approached
the open door, in answer to his gentle tap.
"Is Prime at home?"</p>

<p>He was about to enter, but Mrs. Hawley
quietly motioned him back, and herself
stepped outside, "Mr. Hawley is very ill,"
said she, "and unable to see company."</p>

<p>"May I not be allowed to see him a moment?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just for a moment," he persisted, "I am
really anxious to see Prime."</p>

<p>"No, sir; his life might be the forfeit."</p>

<p>"Now, really, Mrs. Hawley&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Glutter," said she, interrupting him,
"have you forgotten your conduct to me the
last time we met?" and a burning spot came
to her cheeks, and scathing words dropped
from her lips. "You know too well, sir, that
my home is desolate, my heart is broken, and
my husband is murdered, all through the influence
of your cursed business. I thought I
would treat you politely, Mr. Glutter, but I
cannot. God forgive me. Leave me; the
very sight of you makes me desperate. Leave
me, I say, if you would not again have the
curse of a drunkard's wife fall upon your
blackened soul."</p>

<p>"What a perfect she-devil you are," said
Hank, now throwing off all restraint. "I
mean to see Prime, spite of you."</p>

<p>"Try it, if you dare," said she, and her
eyes flashed and sparkled with a desperate
purpose, as she planted herself in the door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then, Dr. Goodrich and daddy, on their
return trip, were seen approaching.</p>

<p>"You'll repent this," said her persecutor
with an oath, and immediately withdrew.</p>

<p>He went directly to the cove where Little
Wolf's boat was usually moored. It was not
there, and he took courage.</p>

<p>"Bloody Jim could not be hurt much," he
soliloquized in an undertone, "or he couldn't
have taken the boat away. I shall manage
that girl yet, and that Sherman, too, if he
don't take care of himself. They'll be lovers,
I see that plainly enough. So much the
better; moonlight walks will follow, as a
matter of course. Now we'll see who will
beat in this game."</p>

For Winter Interrupted&mdash;The Welcome Boat.</b></p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/capT.jpg" width="100" height="160" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p class="dropcap">hree months had passed, and during
that time, Dr. DeWolf had entirely recovered
his health. Prime Hawley was
up and doing, following with renewed vigor
his former pursuits; threats and entreaties
had wrung from him a half-hearted confession,
but, out of pity for his wife, the affair
was hushed up, and he was saved from merited
punishment.</p>

<p>Bloody Jim had not been seen or heard of,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
and he alone carried the secret of Hank
Glutter's criminal designs.</p>

<p>Edward Sherman had become an almost
daily visitor at Dr. DeWolf's, and while his
friend Dr. Goodrich was establishing himself
in his profession at Pendleton, he was gradually
gaining a more certain hold, on the affections
of Little Wolf.</p>

<p>Our heroine was still, to all appearance,
the same little bundle of contradictions that
she had always been.</p>

<p>"There, I'm always sure to do the very
thing I say I will not do," she said to herself
half pettishly, as she opened her piano with
a jerk, and ran her fingers carelessly, over the
keys, one fine October day.</p>

<p>Very soon she was quite absorbed, in practicing
a difficult piece of music, which her
lover had, heretofore, recommended in vain.</p>

<p>"O, Miss DeWolf, there's a squaw here
that wants to see you," said Sorrel Top,
bursting suddenly into the room.</p>

<p>"O, she's begging, no doubt. Give her
what she wants, Sorrel Top, I'm engaged just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
now," and Little Wolf went on with her
music.</p>

<p>"There, I told you so. I knowed Miss
DeWolf wouldn't have nothing to do with
squaws, or injins, nor nothing else that's low,"
exclaimed Sorrel Top, loud enough to be
heard by her young mistress, who always
made it a point to do the very thing it was
expected she would not do.</p>

<p>The dumpy little copper-colored creature,
enveloped in an Indian blanket, before whom
Sorrel Top had drawn herself up with a triumphant
toss of the head, was just making a
second plea, when Little Wolf made her appearance.</p>

<p>"I want to hear music, do tell the lady I
want to hear music," she said in very good
English.</p>

<p>"O, if that's what you want, come this
way," said Little Wolf, leading on to the
parlor.</p>

<p>The Indian followed, pattering along in
her soft moccasins, leaving Sorrel Top quite
crest fallen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now here is where the music comes from,"
said Little Wolf, placing her hand upon the
instrument, and following her piece of information
with a lively air.</p>

<p>"Now, how do you like that?"</p>

<p>"It is very pretty; may I try to make
music?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Little Wolf, vacating
her seat with infinite condescention. The
maiden drew her blanket more closely around
her, and made it fast. Her exceedingly small
and finely formed hands were now at liberty,
and, instead of the discordant notes which
her auditor fully expected, a flood of harmonious
sounds burst upon her ear.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" exclaimed Little
Wolf in utter astonishment, when the strains
had ceased.</p>

<p>The performer bent upon her a long searching
look, and enquired, "Are you Miss De
Wolf?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>The strange visitor immediately rose and
approached the door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"There! stop; who are you?" demanded
Little Wolf, vehemently.</p>

<p>"Hush! I was going to bolt the door,"
and she deliberately turned the key in the
lock. "I'm your friend, young lady, and
I'm come to warn you of impending danger."</p>

<p>Little Wolf slightly paled, but she stood
firm awaiting further developments.</p>

<p>"Too much time has been wasted already,"
she began, "Bloody Jim is here, at Chimney
Rock, waiting for the first favorable moment
to kidnap you, and murder your servants,
and set fire to your home. He is now more
daring and reckless than ever. Three times
you have thwarted him, and he still carries
the scars he has received at your hands.
This is the day, and, for ought I know, the
very hour, that he designs to fall upon you.
It was to be when your father was helplessly
intoxicated, and yourself entirely off your
guard. I think he has two or three accomplices
living in this place. I love Bloody
Jim, steeped in crime as he is, and I beg of
you, if it shall be possible for you to save<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
yourself without taking his life, you will do
so. I have now done all I can for you; good
bye."</p>

<p>"There, you shall not go," exclaimed Little
Wolf, springing towards her, "you must stay
and assist me."</p>

<p>"I can do nothing more for you, Miss De
Wolf, indeed, I cannot. I have told you all
I know. My journey has been exceedingly
painful and perilous, and I am completely
exhausted. If I am discovered, I must inevitably
lose my life. I do not dread death,
but if alive, and you should be captured, I
might possibly render you some assistance.
Now you must not detain me."</p>

<p>"Well, but who are you," persisted Little
Wolf, "that you are able to give me all this
information, and yet cannot give me any
aid?"</p>

<p>"I can, in all probability, aid you more by
going than by remaining," said the other hurriedly.
"My skin is stained, my clothes are
stuffed to give me this fleshy appearance, but
you will recognize me if we meet again. My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
name is Antoinette Le Claire. Now I <i>must</i>
go. The good Lord help you," and she waddled
off, in precise imitation of a fat old
squaw.</p>

<p>"Now I must be brave," thought Little
Wolf, pressing her hand on her brow, while
she tried to think what plan to pursue.</p>

<p>Her first thought was for her father's safety,
who was, as usual, at the brewery, where
he had gone soon after dinner, and as he had
not been there long, she hoped he was not, as
yet, intoxicated.</p>

<p>Stepping to the door, she hailed daddy,
who was busy storing away some vegetables
in the cellar, for winter use. "See here,
daddy, I want you to go down to the brewery
as quick as you can, and tell father&mdash;well,
tell him I'm sick, and want to see him right
away."</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, honey,"&mdash;</p>

<p>"O, go, this minute, daddy," and she shut
the door in his face, and proceeded to the
kitchen, where she found mammy quietly
smoking her pipe in the corner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, mammy, where is Sorrel Top?" said
she.</p>

<p>"Sorrel Top, why she's picking grapes for
that are jelly you wanted made. I'm going
to help her when I git rested, and slick up a
leetle."</p>

<p>"No, mammy, you must help me. Bloody
Jim is around here somewhere, and he's going
to try to kill us all and burn the house.
I've just sent daddy for father, and you had
better call Sorrel Top. I'll get my pistols,
and we'll secure the house."</p>

<p>"O, laws a mercy! how did you find it
out, honey?"</p>

<p>"Wait 'till we are safe and I'll tell you."</p>

<p>"O, honey, did you tell daddy?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"O, I'm awful glad, he'd be so flustrated
you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; now don't you get flustrated,
and let it out quite yet, you had better
tell Sorrel Top, though."</p>

<p>Sorrel Top was duly informed, and they
all set to work, and had made what arrange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>ments
for their safety they could, when daddy
returned.</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, Honey, the Doctor can't come."</p>

<p>Little Wolf knew, by the expression on the
old servant's face, why her father could not
come, and she went up close to him, and whispered,
"Is he very bad, daddy?"</p>

<p>"O yes, pet, 'tween you and me, he's dead drunk."</p>

<p>A shiver ran through the daughter at this
intelligence, and she now felt strong suspicions
that Hank Glutter was implicated in
her enemy's plot, and the condition of her
father indicated that the crisis was near at
hand.</p>

<p>"Well, daddy, cannot you get him some
way?" she enquired, after a moment's thought,
"can't you get some of the men to help
you?"</p>

<p>"There ain't nobody there but Hank Glutter."</p>

<p>"Well, won't he assist you?"</p>

<p>"Bless your heart, honey, no&mdash;he ordered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
me off when I was there just now, and said
things it wouldn't do for you to hear, no
how."</p>

<p>"If you should write him a little billet and
ask him, may be he would," suggested mammy.</p>

<p>The note was speedily dispatched, and ran
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Will Mr. Glutter do Miss DeWolf the
favor to assist the bearer, in bringing her
father home."</p></div>

<p>"Now, honey, 'tween you and me," said
daddy, who soon after returned in high displeasure,
"that Hank Glutter can lie as fast
as a hoss can trot. He turned red clar up to
his har, when he read your billet, and sez he
to me, 'go tell Miss DeWolf that I've sprained
my right arm, and can't lift a pound.'"</p>

<p>"The Lord be praised, there's a steamer
coming," exclaimed Little Wolf.</p>

<p>All eyes were instantly turned in the direction
of the river, and several miles away,
the smoke bursting from the tall pipes of a
steamboat, and curling towards the clouds,
was distinctly visible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, daddy, you must take that boat
and carry a letter to&mdash;to Mr. Sherman, and
we'll see if we can't outwit Mr. Glutter."</p>

<p>"O, but, honey, 'tween you and me, them
'taters and things must be got in. What if
we should have a frost to-night, and spile
'em. Hank will send the Doctor home when
it's time to lock up, and it don't make much
difference whether he's here or there."</p>

<p>"Yes, it does, daddy, and I'm bound to
have father home, now I've set out, so you
run to the landing, and give the signal."</p>

<p>"Hurry him up, mammy," she whispered
to her housekeeper, and immediately went to
her writing desk.</p>

<p>"Laws, how can I leave them are taters,
mammy?" he said, appealing to his better-half.</p>

<p>"Laws, you can git back in time to kiver
'em up; you'll better let 'em spile and keep
on the right side of the pet. Likely she's
got something <i>particular</i> she wants to say to
Mr. Sherman; girls is up to sich things.
There, now, you'd better leave, that are boat
is heaving in sight."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Chimney Rock was one of those insignificant
points, on the Upper Mississippi, where
steamers seldom had occasion to land, and it
became necessary to hoist a signal, when any
of the inhabitants wished to take passage on
a boat from that place.</p>

<p>Daddy vigorously waved his red flag to
and fro, and the result was, in ten minutes,
he had embarked on board the steamer "Golden
Era," with Little Wolf's communication
stowed safely away in his pocket.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">r. Goodrich's cosey office, situated
on the corner of Second and Centre
Streets, in the village of Pendleton, was
a convenient lounging place for Edward Sherman,
and it so happened that on the very day
that Little Wolf had dispatched her messenger,
he had repaired thither to read his newspapers
and letters, smoke cigars, and indulge in the
comfort which a confidential chat with a
friend, generally affords to a companionable
mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"See here, Doctor," said he, depositing the
bundle of mail matter on the office table, and
seating himself in an arm-chair beside it.</p>

<p>"Anything for me?" said the Doctor, who
was busy arranging some papers.</p>

<p>"A letter from <i>her</i>," said Edward, with
slow, droll emphasis.</p>

<p>"Really, Ned, that is decidedly cool. How
long do you propose to make me wait for it?"</p>

<p>"Help yourself, Doctor. It's there among
the papers," said Edward, lighting a cigar.</p>

<p>Occasionally, Edward glanced over the top
of his newspaper to observe the animated
countenance of his friend, as he perused the
lines traced by the hand of love.</p>

<p>Having thus marked his progress to the
end, he enquired, "Now, Doctor, what says
my little sister?"</p>

<p>"She says, Ned, 'this is now the middle of
Autumn.'"</p>

<p>"O, is that <i>all</i>?"</p>

<p>"Well, the next in order is,'and mother is
expecting Edward home soon.'"</p>

<p>"That is just what I have been expecting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
to hear for a week past, Doctor. You know
I have made my success with Miss De Wolf
the condition on which I should be induced
to locate here. Well, I'm pretty sure of her,
and I have at length determined to hang out
my shingle, and go to work. I can see no
way but to persuade mother and Louise to
come out here and live with us."</p>

<p>"Then, you are really engaged to Miss De
Wolf, Ned?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, not exactly. I doubt whether
we shall ever, really, be formally engaged. I
wouldn't be surprised if she told me, an hour
before our marriage, that she didn't intend to
take me; but then, I know she will. Poor
old daddy has frequently volunteered the
information that the Pet will never marry
a man, who has been guilty of drinking a
glass of lager beer. He says she is bitterly
opposed to anything that will <i>'toxicate</i>, but I
suspect the experience she has had with her
father has put those ultra notions into her
head."</p>

<p>"No wonder, Ned; the fact that there are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
hundreds of such cases as Dr. De Wolf's has
influenced my opinion on the subject to a
greater extent, perhaps, than any other, and
really, I'm glad Miss De Wolf favors total
abstinence; I hope she will convert you."</p>

<p>"Never, my friend. I shall always adhere
to the principle that a man is capable of controlling
his appetite, within the bounds of
reason. Let a man but <i>will</i> to drink moderately,
and he can."</p>

<p>"But, Ned, a person seldom <i>wills</i> to drink
moderately, but ends by <i>willing</i> to drink immoderately.
Now in such cases what becomes
of your theory?"</p>

<p>"The fact is, Doctor, you and I have so
often discussed the subject, that I believe
there is nothing new left to be said, on either
side. I wish Hank Glutter was here, and he
would show you in five minutes, why we
should not deprive ourselves of the gifts of
Providence, simply because others have abused
them."</p>

<p>"I pity a drunkard, Ned," said the Doctor,
very quietly, "but I despise a drunkard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>-maker,
and the less conversation I have with
one of that class, the better."</p>

<p>The color quickly mounted to Edward's
face, but a loud knock at the door suspended
his reply.</p>

<p>"Come in," said the Doctor, and in stalked
daddy.</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, Mr. Sherman," said
he, approaching Edward, "the honey has
sent you a letter; here it is."</p>

<p>Edward received the letter with a mixture
of surprise and pleasure, which he could not
conceal.</p>

<p>Unfolding it with nervous haste, he ran his
eye over the few brief lines. "Good heavens!"
he exclaimed, starting to his feet,
"Bloody Jim is at Chimney Rock again."</p>

<p>Daddy sprang forward, with dilated eyes
and open mouth, and fastened his grip upon
Edward, who comprehended in an instant
why the old man had not been apprized of
the nature of his errand, and he resolved on
returning him to his former state of blissful
ignorance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me see; have I made a mistake?"
said he, again looking over the letter, "Bloody
Jim is not at Chimney-Rock, after all."</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, what made you
think he was?" said daddy, whose panic began
to subside.</p>

<p>"O, I saw his name, and took it for granted
he was there. I did not quite make out
what was said."</p>

<p>"The billet was writ in a hurry, Mr. Sherman;
you must excuse it. The honey is the
most distinctest writer I knows on. She got
a wonderful edication down thar, in New
York; 'tween&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss DeWolf wants me to go to Chimney
Rock immediately," said Edward, arresting
the words on the lips of his garrulous visitor.</p>

<p>"Sartain, I know'd it."</p>

<p>"The Doctor will go with us, and I want
you to go to Frink's stable and order the
horses; we will be ready by the time you
come round."</p>

<p>"I'll dew it."</p>

<p>"Now in the name of wonder, what does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
all this mean?" exclaimed the Doctor, as
daddy slammed the door behind him.</p>

<p>Edward handed him Little Wolf's letter,
which merely stated that Bloody Jim was at
Chimney Rock, and she was momentarily expecting
violence at his hands.</p>

<p>No time was lost in vain conjectures; a
constable was engaged, and the friends had
already buckled on their armor, which consisted
of pistols and bowie knives, when
daddy returned with their horses. They
were fleet-footed animals, and he was himself
well mounted.</p>

<p>Not long were the horsemen in reaching
the well-known "Pass," and as they emerged
from the trees, and approached the house, no
indication of the threatened hostilities appeared.
But still they dashed along over
the fallen leaves and faded turf, and drew up
in front of Dr. De Wolf's.</p>

<p>All was quiet about the old brown house.
They dismounted and approached the door,
daddy leading the way, with the air of a
conqueror. He saw in imagination his young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
mistress triumphing over the discomfited Hank
Glutter, and he greatly gloried in the anticipated
conquest.</p>

<p>His companions were secretly uneasy at
the unusual stillness which reigned around,
and when he attempted to open the front
door, and it resisted his efforts, Edward anxiously
stepped forward and knocked loudly
and hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the old man complacently,
"I guess them women folks have gone
out. I'll just step around the back way, and
let you in."</p>

<p>The gentlemen followed him without ceremony
into the kitchen, and the first object
that met their horrified sight, was mammy,
stretched lifeless on the floor.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to describe the grief
and terror which took possession of daddy,
or the agony of doubt which sent Edward
like a madman through the house. As he
flung open the door of a spacious sleeping
apartment on the second floor, clouds of smoke
and flame drove him back. A pile of light<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
bedding and other inflammable articles had
been set on fire near the centre of the room,
but the fire had not, as yet, communicated
itself to the building, and Edward, finding
water near by, soon succeeded in extinguishing
the flames.</p>

<p>While he was thus engaged, Sorrel Top
emerged from an adjoining chamber, trembling
so as to be scarcely able to stand.</p>

<p>"Where is Miss De Wolf?" exclaimed Edward.</p>

<p>"O, they've carried her off; oh! oh! oh!"&mdash;and
a long shudder shook her frame.</p>

<p>"Sorrel Top," said Edward, assuming calmness
in order to allay her fears, "there is no
immediate danger, and I want you to tell me
as distinctly as you can, all that has occurred."</p>

<p>"O, Mr. Sherman, Bloody Jim has been
here. I expect it was he, and we were watching
for him, too, but we didn't any of us see
him come. I was watching on the east side
of the house, and mammy was watching in
the kitchen, and I could see Miss De Wolf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
through the long hall, standing right by that
window there, looking out, and Bloody Jim
came up behind her sly, and catched her before
she saw him at all. She screeched out,
and tried to get away, but he held her tight,
and hollered, 'come on, boys.' and two men
run right in, and they tied her hands, and
stopped her mouth, and just strapped a big
blanket around her, and carried her off, and
I ran and hid, for I thought they'd kill me if
they saw me."</p>

<p>"How long since they were here?" said
Edward, eagerly.</p>

<p>"O, it's only a little while, and may be
you can ketch 'em," said Sorrel Top, brightening
up a little.</p>

<p>Sorrel Top's reply infused a bright ray of
hope into Edward's highly wrought feelings,
and, accompanied by his friends, he immediately
started in pursuit.</p>

<p>Just outside the house they met Mrs. Hawley,
who informed them, that sometime before
she had seen three men going towards the
brewery. To the brewery they quickly went.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
The wily proprietor denied having seen the
fugitives, and feigned excessive emotion when
informed of their inhuman deeds.</p>

<p>"In what direction would you advise us
to search, Mr. Glutter?" said Edward.</p>

<p>"O, you had better strike off among the
bluffs. They could hardly take the river by
daylight without being discovered. Probably
they will reach some point above here after
dark, and cross to the other side under cover
of night. I will dispatch a messenger to
Pendleton for aid. My men, unfortunately,
are gone after grain, and I am uncertain when
they will return. Dr. DeWolf, I am sorry to
say, is perfectly helpless to-day. While I
was out a few minutes he helped himself too
freely."</p>

<p>Hank Glutter faithfully performed his
promises. The same evening officers of justice
were sent out from Pendleton, and a
party of young men volunteered their services,
and like Edward and the Doctor,
travelled many miles. But all in vain, Bloody
Jim had escaped with his prize.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class="chaphead"><p><b>Bloody Jim's Advantages&mdash;The Fainting
Captive&mdash;The Tragic Quarrel&mdash;Outwitted at Last&mdash;The Refuge.</b></p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 110px;">
<img src="images/capH.jpg" width="110" height="160" alt="H" title="H" />
</div><p class="dropcap">is intimate acquaintance with the wild
region of country, over which he directed
his course, gave Bloody Jim an
immense advantage over his pursuers.</p>

<p>While they were floundering in treacherous
sloughs, or climbing unknown heights, he was
riding safely and swiftly along in company
with his prisoner and the two villians, whom
Sorrel Top described as having assisted in
kidnapping her mistress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Wolf was so narrowly watched by
the trio that escape seemed impossible. As
each hour bore her farther from civilization,
and nearer to the Red River country, her
heart sank within her.</p>

<p>She was compelled to pursue her journey
a large portion of each night, and when her
captors stopped for rest and refreshment, she
was either lashed to a tree, or bound, so as to
be unable to rest with the slightest ease or
comfort.</p>

<p>Under such rigorous treatment her strength
rapidly declined, and, at the close of the third
day, entirely failed. They had reached the
foot of a beautiful wooded bluff at a bend in
the Mississippi, where the town of St. Cloud
has since been located. Here they were suddenly
brought to a stand; the poor jaded
captive had fainted.</p>

<p>Bloody Jim saw her reeling in her saddle
and instantly threw his brawny arm around
her frail form. Dismounting, and laying his
unconscious burden on a bed of dry leaves,
which the wind had gathered under a huge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
oak, he produced from his knapsack a bottle
of brandy, and proceeded to wet her face,
and force a few drops into her mouth.</p>

<p>At the sight of the long-concealed bottle,
his men chuckled with delight, and as soon
as Little Wolf exhibited signs of returning
life, they requested a "treat."</p>

<p>Bloody Jim, now deeming himself beyond
pursuit for one night at least, acceded to their
wishes, and also himself indulged in his favorite
beverage.</p>

<p>Little Wolf gathered from their conversation
and movements that they designed to
camp for the night at their present station,
and their occasional rude allusions to herself
filled her with terror. She struggled to throw
off the oppressive faintness which she felt a
second time stealing upon her, but, when she
saw Bloody Jim approaching her, the horrors
of her situation completely overcame her, and
she again swooned.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" grunted the disappointed savage,
giving her inanimate form a rude kick.</p>

<p>"She wake before morning," suggested one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
of his comrades encouragingly, as he passed
him the precious bottle.</p>

<p>Bloody Jim took it, put it to his lips,
drained it dry, and handed it back.</p>

<p>This was too much for his already
half drunk consoler; he angrily flung the
empty bottle into Bloody Jim's face, and in
retaliation received in a twinkling his death
stab.</p>

<p>Half breed No. 3 observed the transaction
with evident satisfaction. He applauded the
murderer and cajoled him into furnishing
from, the bowels of his knapsack a fresh supply
of the poisonous liquor.</p>

<p>After gratifying their rum appetite to the
full, the athletic men gradually became as
helpless as infants, and, sinking on the ground
as the darkness gathered around them, they
fell into heavy sleep.</p>

<p>In about an hour Little Wolf partially recovered,
but, supposing herself to be closely
guarded, and still suffering from extreme
lassitude, she closed her eyes, and gradually
fell into profound slumber.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>The hours glided on. The waning moon
looked sadly in through the branches of the old
oaks upon the sleepers. There lay the murdered
man with his upturned, ghastly face;
scattered near him were the fragments of the
broken bottle. Yet a little further on were
the prostrate forms of his guilty fellows, and
still beyond reclined the innocent one.</p>

<p>There was a rustling among the leaves and
light footsteps drew near, and Antoinette Le
Clare gazed upon the scene. She was still
habited in her Indian costume. Softly approaching
Little Wolf she as softly awoke
her.</p>

<p>Little Wolf looked up wildly into the dark
face that bent over her and recognized it in a
moment. Antoinette silently assisted her to
rise, undid her fetters, and taking her hand,
noiselessly led her from the spot.</p>

<p>The staggering gait of her companion disclosed
to Antoinette her extreme weakness
hoping to revive her drooping energies she
whispered "Courage a little longer, Miss de
Wolf, and you are safe."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've courage enough to put an end to
them," said Little Wolf, with a momentary
flash of her wonted spirit, "but I'm so dizzy."</p>

<p>"Well, rest here while I bring my pony."</p>

<p>"No, I'll go with you," and by an act of
the will Little Wolf forced herself along until
they reached the shaggy little Indian pony
on the glade.</p>

<p>This they both mounted, Little Wolf still
struggling bravely with her increasing illness.
But it was all in vain; a violent fever was
seizing upon her. She was alternately distressed
with hot flashes and cold chills, and
worse still, her mind began to wander.</p>

<p>Antoinette was in deep distress. Her plan
to fly for protection to the nearest settlement
was completely frustrated. It was too far;
she could not hope to reach it in safety.
But, thinking she might possibly discover a
place of refuge in some other direction, she
turned her horse and dashed off she knew not
whither.</p>

<p>Having rode on for several miles over prairie
and oak openings, determining to put all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
possible distance between herself and Bloody
Jim, a most welcome sight met her view.</p>

<p>It was a log cabin standing on an eminence,
comfortable in appearance and snugly embosomed
in a grove of trees.</p>

<p>As there was no enclosure around it, she
rode close to the door, and, without dismounting;
knocked loudly with her riding whip.</p>

<p>An echo was her only reply. The same
results followed repeated attempts to obtain a
hearing, and she came to the conclusion that
the house was either unoccupied, or the inmates
were insensible to noise. The former
proved to be the case, and what was more
unpleasant, the door was firmly fastened.</p>

<p>Letting the invalid&mdash;whom she had supported
partly by her arm and partly by fastening
her blanket around both&mdash;slide softly
to the ground, Antoinette dismounted and
effected an entrance through a small window.
There was but one room in the dwelling, and
this was scantily furnished. A bed, a cook-stove,
a flour barrel and a chest occupied each
a corner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>On a couple of hooks that were fastened to
a beam overhead rested a rifle, and from a
peg at the side was suspended a violin. A
hat, an old pair of boots, pushed partly under
the bed, and several other articles of men's
wearing apparel lying about the room, proclaimed
the abode of a single man.</p>

<p>The door was secured within by a wooden
bar, which Antoinette speedily removed, and,
by extraordinary exertions on the part of her
friend, Little Wolf was removed to a comfortable
couch in the cabin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class="chaphead"><p><b>The Kidnapper's Surprise&mdash;On the
Wrong Track&mdash;Bloody Jim's Capture&mdash;The Power of Habit&mdash;Dispair&mdash;The
Rotten Plank.</b></p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/capI.jpg" width="100" height="160" alt="I" title="I" />
</div><p class="dropcap">t was late on the following morning
when Bloody Jim awoke. He rubbed
his eyes and scratched his head with a
vacant stare, for he did not at first remember
where he was. When the objects by which
he was surrounded had sufficiently refreshed
his memory he began to look about for his
prisoner and, behold, she was nowhere to be
seen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>He ground his teeth with rage. "Ketchum,"
he said, giving his still snoring companion
a tremendous shake, "wake up, that
d&mdash;&mdash;d gal is gone."</p>

<p>"Gone!" exclaimed Ketchum, starting up
and beating around among the bushes, "she
aint gone far I reckon."</p>

<p>"She has too," said Bloody Jim, following
his exclamation with an oath.</p>

<p>"How do you know, Jim?"</p>

<p>"That horse she's taken, Ketchum, will
travel like lightning."</p>

<p>Now it so happened that the animal alluded
to had broken loose during the night, and,
as Bloody Jim had appropriated his services
without consulting his master, who was an
honest farmer living in the vicinity of St.
Paul, the sagacious beast deliberately set out
to return to his former comfortable quarters.</p>

<p>The natural conclusion of the villains was
that Little Wolf had fled on their missing
horse, and so when they had succeeded in
finding his track they followed it. Mile after
mile of their former route was retraced.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Hour after hour they plodded on, scarcely
stopping to give their beasts necessary rest
until the night overtook them, and then were
only delayed for a short time. They rose
with the moon, and, in a few hours actually
came in sight of the deserter. He was drinking
at the river's brink within sound of the
roar of St. Anthony's Falls. Perceiving his
pursuers approaching, the noble beast threw
up his head, gave a loud snort and darted off.</p>

<p>Bloody Jim gave an impatient grunt, but
Ketchum clapped his hands with delight.
"Golly: the gal must be near here," said he.</p>

<p>"No, me think she got to the tavern on
yonder hill. We must find a hiding place,
Ketchum, and me have the gal yet, or the
constable have me."</p>

<p>Bloody Jim little thought when he made
his boast that he would be in the power of
the constable before night, but so it was.
The riderless horse having been seen at St.
Anthony's, suspicions were aroused, a search
was instituted, and the result was the capture
of the imprudent and high-handed outlaw.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>To all questions put to him concerning Little
Wolf, he had but one answer, "me not
know."</p>

<p>Threats and bribes elicited nothing more
and it was generally supposed that he had
murdered her. But as the whole affair was
shrouded in mystery, there was some few inclined
to the opinion, that she was secreted
in some place, from which the protracted absence
of Bloody Jim would give her an opportunity
to escape. Among the last named
was Dr. Goodrich and Edward Sherman.</p>

<p>The Doctor was not at the examination of
the prisoner, and Edward hastened to inform
him of the result. He was at his old haunt,
and, as usual, under the influence of stimulus
when Edward entered.</p>

<p>"No satisfactory information could be obtained
from the old scoundrel," said he,
throwing himself upon a lounge.</p>

<p>The events of the past few days had worn
upon him, and his anxious look did not escape
Hank Glutter, who turned away to conceal
his exultation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor fellow, he too mourns for her,"
thought Edward, mistaking his movement for
one of grief.</p>

<p>After a moment's silence, Hank poured out
something from the bar. "Drink this, Sherman,"
said he, passing it to Edward, "I see
you are tired; it will strengthen you."</p>

<p>Since Edward's entrance, Dr. DeWolf had
sat gazing at him fixedly. The bleared, dull
light of his eyes gave place to a keen, wild
expression as Edward accepted the proffered
glass.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sherman," said he, in an unusually
strong voice, "do you see what is in that
cup?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, doctor; it is wine."</p>

<p>"Yes, surely it is wine," replied the other
"and your inexperienced eye sees nothing
more than a harmless beverage; neither did
this bleared and bloated old man see more than
that in his wine years ago. Ah! could he
have seen in his youth the vision in his cup
which he now sees in that which you now
hold to your lips, he might have been saved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
from a life of disgrace and ruin. The chain
which once bound me was as light as that
which now binds you."</p>

<p>"No chain binds <i>me</i>," said Edward proudly.
"I need not drink this unless I choose."</p>

<p>"It seems but yesterday, Edward Sherman
since I addressed similar language to your
father, and well do I remember his arguments
to induce me to abandon every beverage that
could intoxicate. I recollect how I loathed
the drunkard, as you do me, and how my
proud heart rebelled at the humiliating
thought that habit would ever become too
strong to be controlled by my will; but boastings
were vain; the time will shortly come
when I shall sink into a drunkard's hell&mdash;and
you, poor Hank, will be there too," he
continued, turning to Hank Glutter, "you
will be sent down to wait upon your customers.
You must stand behind your flaming
bar and pour out the liquid fire and brimstone
for such as I; but, never mind, the traffic will
enrich you with showers of molten gold. No
drop from God's pure fountain to cool your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
parched tongue. One long eternal blaze shall
light up your saloon. Drunken devils reeling
to and fro&mdash;Oh! I see them now"&mdash;and
the doctor gave, a fearful shriek and fell upon
the floor.</p>

<p>He raved frightfully for hours, but in an
interval of calmness was removed to his desolate
home.</p>

<p>The loss of his wife had entirely unfitted
daddy for active service, and Sorrel Top, on
account of her youth and inexperience, was
an inefficient nurse: consequently Mrs. Hawley's
services were engaged. Edward also
bestowed every attention in his power, but
the delirium tremens had fixed upon his aged
friend and his horrid imaginings continued for
days.</p>

<p>It was impossible for Edward, who was the
soul of humanity, to witness unmoved the
doctor's terrible agony, and, at such seasons,
he would invariably resolve that he would
put forth an effort to reclaim him. "I will
reason with him and show him the folly of
his course," said he to himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>When the invalid was able to bear conversation,
Edward approached him on the subject
as delicately as possible.</p>

<p>"Dr.," said he, "I am young to advise one
like you, but if you would permit me, I think
I could prescribe a remedy for your disease,
and one that would ensure you a hale, hearty
old age."</p>

<p>"I know what you would say, Edward,"
replied the Dr., rising upon his elbow, "but
I cannot do it. I cannot let drink alone. I
must drink if it kills me. Times without
number I have forsworn it, and I will never
add another broken vow to my perjured soul.
If you would be useful in the cause of temperance,
Edward, if you would save such as
I, and, what is more important, if you would
save the young, then use all your influence
to stop the liquor traffic."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not at all ultra," said Edward,
somewhat embarrassed, "I have never given
the subject which you mention much
thought."</p>

<p>"Then it is high time you should," said the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Dr., warming up with a look of lofty enthusiasm,
"I am sober now, Edward, and I may
never be in my right mind again. I <i>must</i>
drink to-day, I know I can get it, and I will
have it; I suppose you would say, 'if he will
go to the devil, let him go;' but I say, if
there was no drink to be had, if it were not
sold here, if it were not sold elsewhere, I
could not get it, and I should be saved. A
law prohibiting the sale of intoxicating drinks
is what is most needed. I know these sentiments
coming from one like me sound strangely,
but, Edward, such a law enforced in my
native state would have saved me, and I know
it. Such a law now enforced in all our states
would restore many a besotted husband to a
broken-hearted wife; many a lost son to a
widowed mother, many a darling brother to
a distressed and mortified sister. It would
bring light and gladness to thousands of sorrowful
hearts and homes; it would feed the
hungry, clothe the naked. Less blood would
cry aloud to heaven for vengeance, and less
crime of every description would be commit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>ted.
This lovely territory will soon become
a state; here you will rise to eminence in
your profession. I know it will be so. You
possess your father's talents, and you also
possess his high social qualities, which, at one
time, brought him to the verge of ruin.
Judge Sherman did not at first love drink,
but he often drank to please his friends. His
associates tarried at the wine, and he would
be one with them. The secret, Edward, of
the fall of nine-tenths of our young men is
social drinking; now, moral suasion has saved
many, and no doubt will save many more.
But would you give the serpent his death
wound, then bring the arm of the law down
upon him and it is done."</p>

<p>"The prohibitory liquor law of Maine has
been said to have worked wonders," said Edward
rather faintly, "but it is thought to be
unconstitutional, by many of our best lawyers."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly it has been so declared,"
said the Dr., "but I would be sorry to believe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
the opinion correct; would not you, Edward?"</p>

<p>The Dr. fixed his piercing eyes upon Edward,
for he began to suspect that his young
friend's views did not coincide with those
which he had expressed.</p>

<p>Edward moved uneasily in his chair, bit
his lips, and finally stammered out, "Well, I
don't know Dr., really, it seems like depriving
a man of his liberty to legislate upon
what he shall, or shall not sell."</p>

<p>"Even if he sells that which he knows will
craze his neighbor's brain, and cause him to
commit the most atrocious crimes? When
an individual directly, or indirectly aids and
abets crime, ought he to escape punishment?"</p>

<p>Edward saw that he stood upon a plank of
the rotten old platform, upon which so many
have broken through, though they still hold
to the decaying posts, and he ingeniously
evaded the question.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid, Dr., you are over-exerting
yourself," said he, "I will leave you to rest
while I walk out and breathe the fresh air."</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">r. Glutter, Dr. DeWolf wants you to
fill this flask with brandy," said Sorrel
Top entering the saloon of the former,
about an hour after Edward had left the latter
to repose.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Hank, with a bland smile.</p>

<p>"Allow me to speak with you a moment,
Mr. Glutter," said Edward Sherman, hastily
leaving his seat near a billiard table, where
he was watching the progress of a game, and
taking Hank aside.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>They whispered earnestly together for a few
moments. "Very well," said Hank in conclusion,
"I am willing to try that experiment
if you wish it, but the Dr. is very stubborn,
I have often tried to check him." Then
turning to Sorrel Top, "Tell the Dr. I have
no brandy."</p>

<p>"Has no brandy?" exclaimed the Dr. as
Sorrel Top delivered her message; "it's a lie.
O, I see how it is; Mr. Sherman was there,
was he not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Here the subject dropped, and the Dr. was
unusually quiet and patient during the remainder
of the day. But when Edward kindly
offered to sit by him during the night, he
would not listen to him.</p>

<p>"No, no," said he "I am quite well; the
parade of watchers would only disturb my
rest," so Edward contented himself to retire
about midnight.</p>

<p>The Dr. lay perfectly quiet for an hour or
two after Edward left him; he then crept
softly out of bed, partially dressed himself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
noiselessly out of bed, partially dressed himself,
and then wrapping a sheet around him,
crept out of the house, by a window which
opened from the room to the piazza. Gliding
down the steps and along the well-worn
path he soon reached the brewery, and, as he
was familiar with every part of the establishment,
found no difficulty in gaining access to
the saloon.</p>

<p>The proprietor was lying fast asleep in a
room from which he could see and be seen by
any one behind the bar. At the first click
of the bottles he partially aroused and opened
his eyes upon his ghost-like visitor.</p>

<p>Enveloped in white, and seen in the obscure
light, the Dr.'s. most familiar friends
could not possibly have recognized him, and
to Hank's half awakened vision, he presented
a really supernatural appearance.</p>

<p>Hank was not naturally superstitious, and,
obeying his first impulse, he shouted out,
"Who in the d&mdash;&mdash;l are you?"</p>

<p>The Dr. made a warning gesture with his
hand, as if to compel silence, and the auda<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>cious
questioner instinctively recoiled further
back in his bed. His courage began to fail
him, and a mixture of fear and astonishment
kept him silent while his visitor remained,
which was only long enough to secure the
prize he was seeking among the contents of
the shelves.</p>

<p>Not suspecting the full extent of the paralyzing
effect his presence had had upon Hank,
and fearing he might attempt to follow, the
Dr. took a circuitous route home, and in his
haste stumbled over something which he discovered
to be a shivering, half naked child,
crouched upon the ground.</p>

<p>"What are you doing out here this time of
night, my little fellow?" said he.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid of papa," sobbed the child, "he
said he'd skin me alive if I didn't get out of
his sight."</p>

<p>"What is your name? Where do you live?
what bad thing have you been doing?" said
the Dr., all in a breath.</p>

<p>"I live in a shanty out there, I am Fanny
Green. I ain't done anything bad but cry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
and I couldn't help it, for papa was striking
mamma so."</p>

<p>"Well, come with me, Fanny, I'll take you
to your home, and I won't let your papa hurt
you."</p>

<p>"Are you an angel?" said Fanny, feeling
of the hand that held hers.</p>

<p>"No, I'm a man, my little girl."</p>

<p>"I thought you were one of those angels
dressed in white that mamma told me about;
they take folks to heaven, and I want to go
there, I don't want to go home."</p>

<p>They had now reached the wretched hovel
that the child called her home, and she began
to weep afresh.</p>

<p>"O, no, no! I dare not go in," she said,
clinging convulsively to her protector, "I'm
afraid he will kill me."</p>

<p>While she was speaking, the door was
roughly flung open, and her unnatural parent
rushed out, brandishing a heavy club; but,
at sight of the figure clad in white, he dropped
his bludgeon and ran off, howling like a
wild beast deprived of its prey.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>With a glad cry the child bounded into the
shanty, and he heard her childish voice saying
"mamma, don't be afraid any more, papa
has gone way off."</p>

<p>On reaching his room, the Dr. was relieved
to find that his absence had remained undiscovered,
and he drank himself off to sleep.
He was, however, suddenly awakened quite
early in the morning by loud exclamations
coming from daddy, and, in the intervals, he
distinguished the sound of the same childlike
voice which was associated with his night's
adventure. Immediately calling his old servant,
he inquired the meaning of the commotion.</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me," said daddy indignantly,
"there's more distruction; little Fanny
Green's mother is dead; that brute of a
husband has fairly killed her; knocked her
skull in with a club."</p>

<p>"When did it happen?"</p>

<p>"O, in the night; Fanny had run out door
for to get out of his reach, and 'tween you
and me, she says a man with a white dress on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
led her back, and she found her mother dead
on the floor. O! we're havin' on't dreadful
now days; spirits walking the airth, never no
good comes of sich things."</p>

<p>The murder and the reputed ghost, whom
several of the inhabitants testified to having
seen at the midnight hour, was the absorbing
topic of conversation in the immediate neighborhood
where the tragedy was enacted.</p>

<p>For several days succeeding the affair Hank
Glutter's saloon was the general rendezvous
of the wonder-loving country people round
about. All appeared to enjoy the tippling
vastly more than Hank himself.</p>

<p>It was not the thought of the needy wife
sighing for the hard earned shilling, with
which to provide for the many little forms
that must go half clad, and the little feet uncovered
during the approaching winter, for
want of those bits of metal ringing out so sadly
as they fell into his drawer, that clouded
his unusually complacent smile; neither was
it the remembrance of the cruel part he had
acted in Little Wolf's abduction that shook<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
his sin-stained soul. He affected to discredit
the appearance of the much-talked-of apparition,
and yet he was continually tormented
with a vague dread of a second visit from his
ghost-ship, which he would have pursuaded
himself was entirely a creature of the imagination,
had not his missing fourth proof brandy
bottle proved the contrary.</p>

<p>He had resolved not to mention the occurrence
that had so strangely disturbed him,
but, being one day alone with Edward, who
had called particularly to make one of a company
who were going out the day following
to renew the search for Little Wolf, he ventured
to communicate his secret to him.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Glutter, why didn't you tell
me before?" said Edward smiling in spite of
the sad errand that had brought him there,
"all this time you have needlessly tormented
yourself."</p>

<p>"How so, Mr. Sherman?"</p>

<p>"Why, Dr. DeWolf swallows a portion of
that fourth proof every day. I have no doubt
it was he who paid you the visit. I am cer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>tain
that he knows something about the murder
of Mrs. Green, and he must have been
the man in white that little Fanny talks
about. I see it all clearly now; Dr. DeWolf
is the ghost, and he has kept his bed to prevent
suspicion."</p>

<p>"I was confident," said Hank with a look
of infinite relief, "that the Dr. would have
his dram, spite of our machinations. I have
known several such cases of apparently insatiable
thirst, and it was impossible to keep
liquor away from them. Sorrel Top's husband,
Harry Herrick, was the worst case of
the kind that ever came under my observation.
He drank quite moderately at first,
but suddenly appeared to have lost all control
over his appetite. I reasoned with him
in vain, and finally, out of pity to his family
I refused him admission here altogether.
Well, the result was he stole from my cellar
what he could not beg; for the miserable
creature was penniless, and before I was
aware of it, he actually drank himself to death.
It happened while Miss DeWolf was away at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
school, and on her return my conduct was
basely misrepresented to her, and she espoused
the widow's cause and took her into her
family, and ever after has treated me with
contempt. However, I harbor no ill will towards
Miss DeWolf. I would gladly make
one of your party, were it not entirely impossible
for me to leave here; but believe me, I
wish you success, Mr. Sherman."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<div class="chaphead"><p><b>The Cottage in the Grove&mdash;The Disguise&mdash;Back
to Health&mdash;Impatience&mdash;Searching the Box&mdash;Antoinette La
Clair's Story.</b></p></div>


<p>Very sad and dreary seemed the hours to
Antoinette La Clair, as she watched by Little
Wolf's bed side. While her loving hand
bathed the burning brow, and her soft musical
voice soothed the wild ravings of the invalid,
she thought much upon the strange
loneliness of their situation. Day after day
passed by, and no living soul approached the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
cottage. She often wondered why it's owner
came not, and it was a mystery to her, why
Bloody Jim had not discovered their retreat.</p>

<p>From the first, she had taken the precaution
whenever she appeared outside to disguise
herself in the various articles of clothing,
which she found strewn about the house,
and, as she went to procure water from the
spring, which was at some distance from the
house, she would assume the air and gait of
a logy country boy. Her sun-burnt straw
hat with its crown piece flapping about in the
wind; great coarse boots slipping hither and
thither on her little feet and her other generally
loose fitting attire would, but for her absorbing
anxiety, have excited rather more than
a smile on her usually melancholly countenance.</p>

<p>It was well that the fact of having remained
unmolested for nearly three weeks did not
lesson her vigilance on one eventful occasion.
It was about sun rise; as she was toiling up
the eminence with a heavy bucket of water,
which an occasional mis-step would send<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
splashing over her great awkward boots, she
saw a man approaching the spring. It was
Ketchum; and, as she recognized him, her
breath came quicker and she hurried onward
and upward. She had nearly reached the top
of the hill when she heard him calling out,</p>

<p>"Hello there, boy!"</p>

<p>She turned round, sat down her bucket and
stood in a listening attitude.</p>

<p>"I say boy, who lives yonder?"</p>

<p>"I du," she replied in exact imitation of
backwoodsman twang, and, taking a step or
two downward, she stooped forward and appeared
to be attentively eyeing her new acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Be you the man they're looking fur?"
she at length drawled out.</p>

<p>"Who's looking fur?" said he with a start.</p>

<p>"Them men at our house."</p>

<p>"No, you fool of a boy."</p>

<p>The last she saw of Ketchum he was hurrying
off with all his might.</p>

<p>Antoinette fairly ran into the house and
closing and barring the door she fell upon her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
knees, and, from her full heart went up to
Heaven a song of thankfulness. Blessings
multiply when gratitude reigns in the soul;
so while Antoinette still knelt a change came
over Little Wolf and consciousness returned.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" she faintly articulated, as
her watchful and tender nurse arose and approached
the bed.</p>

<p>"You are safe, thank God," said Antoinette
bursting into tears.</p>

<p>Antoinette now felt new courage, and,
when Little Wolf was able to bear it, she related
to her that part of their flight of which
the illness of the other prevented her having
any recollection; but carefully avoided any
allusion to her own personal history.</p>

<p>Little Wolf longed to penetrate the mystery
that hung over her benefactress, and she
would often say to herself, as she sat propped
up with pillows watching Antoinette's quiet
movements about the house, "how I wish I
knew more about her; what a romance!"</p>

<p>But as her strength increased, other desires
shared her thoughts more largely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>"How are we to get out of this place?"
she frequently exclaimed, and, as often, Antoinette
would meekly reply, "The Lord will
provide a way."</p>

<p>"Well why don't the Lord provide a way
to get us away from here?" she said one day
rather impatiently as she sat by the window
looking out into the sunshine, "I'm sure I'm
well enough to travel now, and winter is coming
on and, when once the snow falls, we
shall freeze and starve shut up here."</p>

<p>"We shall hardly freeze with that big wood
pile at the door, or starve with a cellar full of
vegetables," said Antoinette pleasantly.</p>

<p>"O Antoinette, I'm sure your faith hangs
on the cellar and woodpile; but, dear me,
I've seen neither; I must peep into the cellar
right away."</p>

<p>"Let me lift the door for you Miss DeWolf."</p>

<p>A light trap door led to the vegetable kingdom
underneath. One glance at the potatoes,
cabbages and onions, which were only
a part of the products of the garden, piled up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
in this ten by twelve hole in the ground was
enough, as Little Wolf declared, to strengthen
the weakest faith.</p>

<p>"Now, if we only had wings, we might
mount to that nice dried venison in the garret,"
she said, glancing upward through a
square opening cut in the rough boards overhead.
"I wonder how they managed to hang
it so high; I do believe the place has been inhabited
by a giant. Now where shall we
hide when we see him coming? O, I'll get
into that huge chest, we little folks might
both hide there. I wonder I hadn't thought
of it before. Why I'm just beginning to feel
like myself; I see how it is, I've been petted
and babied too long. Please help me lift
this heavy lid. O, its locked&mdash;O here's the
key sticking just in this niche, O&mdash;what a
sight!"</p>

<p>Here indeed our heroine had penetrated into
the mysteries of a heterogeneous mass.
Cooking utensils, carpenters' tools, crockery,
salt, pepper, and various other condiments
used in the culinary department were hud<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>dled
together in one end, while the remainder
of the space was appropriated to books and
clothing, and a bachelor's work box, which,
for all the order it boasted, might have belonged
to the indulgent mother of ten children.</p>

<p>Antoinette watched her friend with an
amused expression of countenance, as she flew
from one article to another really delighted
to find some amusement, however simple, to
while away the tedious hours.</p>

<p>"O, John Hanford is our landlord's name.
Here it is on the fly leaf of this book, and
here is a book purporting to be the property
of Antoinette La Clare. Why Antoinette, I
thought the honor of discovering the contents
of this box belonged to me; but really I see
you have been here before me."</p>

<p>"No, Miss DeWolf, I never saw the inside
of the box before, I thought there was no
key."</p>

<p>"Is it possible? Why what does it mean?
Here is surely an old bible with your name<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
written in it in full, 'Antoinette La Clare,'
now here it is, you can see for yourself.</p>

<p>Antoinette eagerly took the book, and, having
examined the name, proceeded to look it
carefully through. It was a pocket bible of
the English version in old fashioned binding,
and bore marks of long and frequent use.</p>

<p>Little Wolf watched Antoinette's varying
countenance as she turned over the leaves.
A ray of pleasure, at first, lighted up her sad,
wistful face, but slowly faded leaving her apparently
more wan and sad than ever, as she
returned the volume in silence.</p>

<p>A vague suspicion of evil crept into Little
Wolf's mind. How came Antoinette's name
in the book and why was she so silent, and
why had she appeared so satisfied to remain
where they were, if she knew no more about
their present abode than she had professed,
were a few of the many questions, which
awakened distrust, suggested to her busy
brain.</p>

<p>The chest had lost its interest and down
came the cover with a bang, sadly startling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
poor Antoinette, who had walked to the window
to hide her fast falling tears.</p>

<p>Little Wolf saw the tears and Antoinette
felt that she had seen them, and the way was
made easy for her to say, "O, Miss DeWolf,
I'm a child of sorrow. I am sometimes almost
overwhelmed with sorrow. Come, let us sit
down together, and I will try to tell you why
it is. It seems but a few days since I gaily
roamed about my childhood's home, hand in
hand with brother Jim, or bloody Jim, as he
is called."</p>

<p>"Bloody Jim your brother! It cannot be
so!" interrupted Little Wolf in amazement,
"I thought he was a half breed."</p>

<p>"So he is a half breed; and he is also my
half brother; my father was of French descent
and, when a young man, he went to the Red
River country and engaged in trapping, and
trading with the Indians. For several years
he made his home principally among the Chippewas,
and, like many others of his class,
married an Indian women; brother Jim was
the fruit of this marriage. His mother was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
accidentally drowned when he was quite an
infant; soon afterwards my father returned
to Canada, leaving his little son in charge of
his Indian grandmother. While there he became
acquainted with my mother, whom he
made his wife with the understanding that
she should accompany him to his wild home
and be a mother to his motherless child. Perhaps
it may be a mystery to you, Miss DeWolf,
that a young and cultivated woman
could have been so readily induced to expose
herself to the hardships and dangers of frontier
life."</p>

<p>"O, no!" broke in Little Wolf, enthusiastically,
"not if she did it for love."</p>

<p>"What do you know about love, Miss DeWolf?"</p>

<p>A conscious blush overspread the pale
young face, for Antoinette accompanied the
question with a wistful enquiring look, that
seemed to reach to her very heart.</p>

<p>"O nothing, my very good, penetrating
friend; please go on with your story. Was
your mother happy?" she asked with a kind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
of nervous haste, as if to compel an immediate
compliance with her request.</p>

<p>"I can not say," said Antoinette very obligingly
relieving the embarrassment she had
occasioned, "I should think she must have
been happy, though, for I believe her short
life was a very useful one. She died at my
birth having been a wife but one year. During
that time, she had by many acts of kindness
greatly endeared herself to the savages,
and the young Indian woman, who had assisted
her in nursing brother Jim, for the love she
bore my mother, reared her little daughter
with unusually tender care. My father survived
her loss but a few weeks, and then
brother Jim and myself were thrown entirely
upon the care of our kind nurse. My mother
had taught her to read and she in turn imparted
such instruction to us as she had received,
or rather I should say her pains were mostly
bestowed upon me, for I was her pet.</p>

<p>Brother Jim grew up like the savages
around him, only, if possible, more vindictive
and revengeful in his nature. I was the only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
being for whom he seemed to entertain the
least affection, and he certainly lavished upon
me wonderful tenderness and love. In his
early youth he gathered for me the rarest
flowers, and, as he grew older, he brought me
game and the choicest fruits, and seemed
never so happy as when promoting my comfort.
For my amusement he brought me a
violin from the distant settlement of Pembinaw,
and at length, gratified my curiosity by
taking me with him in one of his frequent
visits thither. While there my fair skin attracted
the attention of a missionary's family,
and as brother Jim was rather proud of my
parentage, they readily elicited a correct account
of my birth from him, and by appealing
to his pride, at length wrung from him a reluctant
consent to place me for a time under their
tutorage, where, beside making rapid progress,
I cultivated my naturally correct taste
for music. Under their hospitable roof, amid
the refinements and courtisies of civilized life
I spent many happy months."</p>

<p>"At length the last painful illness of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
faithful nurse, who had never ceased to mourn
my absence, recalled me to her. After her
death I was exceedingly sad and lonely, and,
to add to my sorrows, brother Jim had acquired
a love for strong drink, and frequently
came to our lodge in a state of intoxication.
I grieved over his infatuation and reasoned
with him in his sober hours, but all in vain;
he grew worse and worse, and often treated
me harshly, In despair I went to the trader
who I knew supplied him with whiskey and
entreated him with tears not to sell him any
more. I received from him only insults."</p>

<p>"Of course, you might have known what
to expect from one of that class," said Little
Wolf with flashing eyes, "I discovered long
ago, that there was no mercy in the heart of
the liquor dealer. They know it's a mean
business and any one who engages in it must
first harden his heart enough to turn away
from tears of blood."</p>

<p>"I don't think <i>all</i> who engage in the traffic
realize the consequences accruing from it,"
Antoinette mildly replied. "I am sure no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
humane person would continue in it, if they
once took into consideration the vast amount
of misery occasioned by it. I am sure brother
Jim was bad enough before he began to drink;
but after that he became as unmanageable
as a wild beast. Still, alone in the world, I
clung to him with all the warm affection of
my nature.</p>

<p>"A few months after the death of my nurse,
he was pursuaded to join a party from Pembinaw,
who were going on their annual visit to
St. Paul for the purpose of trading with the
whites. At my earnest request he permitted
me to accompany him. I was then in my
fifteenth year, and mere child as I was, he
left me the first day of our arrival entirely
alone in our encampment at St. Paul, while
he went with the rest of the company to the
city.</p>

<p>"By chance a gentleman passing, heard
the sound of the violin, with which I was beguiling
the tedious hours, and came into my
tent. At first I was quite alarmed at sight
of a stranger, but his words and manner im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>mediately
won my confidence, and put my
fears to rest, and, I confess, I was lonelier
when he left me and glad when he came again.
He knew my unprotected situation, and always
made it a point to come when brother
Jim was absent. It would be quite impossible
for me to describe to you the subtile influence
which this person gained over me. I
learned to love him with all the ardor of which
my passionate and imaginative nature was
capable. It was the first unbounded devotion
of a warm and innocent heart that he betrayed.
I have no words with which to convey
an adequate idea of the anguish which I suffered
at parting with him. He promised to
follow me and make me his wife, but he never
came, and at a time when I was least able
to bear it, I was subject to brother Jim's fury.
His cruelty brought me near to death, and
my sufferings only aggravated his bitterness
and wrath. With awful curses he swore vengeance
on the man for whom I would even
then have laid down my life.</p>

<p>"As soon as my strength would permit, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
fled to my friends at Pembinaw. I told them
all, even of my shame, which a little grave
had forever hid from the world. Like true
Christians they soothed my sorrows, and gave
me the place in their family which their only
daughter, who had married and left them
during my absence, had occupied. Several
years had passed away, and the good missionary
died. His wife soon followed him, and I
was again left alone. I had never seen brother
Jim since I left him, but had frequently
heard of his wicked deeds. I thought now
that I would go with my life in my hand and
seek him out and try once more by affectionate
pursuasion, to induce him to give up his
reckless life. Accordingly, I mounted my
pony and set out for my former wild home.
Reaching the lodge after nightfall, to my surprise
I heard voices within. I did not go in,
but stood listening at the entrance. I heard
brother Jim and his companions propose a
plan to capture you. They were to start that
very night; so I hid myself among the trees
and waited until they were gone. Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
I went in for the night, and the next morning
set out to do what I could towards rescuing
you.</p>

<p>"Now I have told you all, Miss DeWolf,
and our Heavenly Father alone knows our
future. As for my name in that bible, you
know as much about it as I do. I never saw
the book before."</p>

<img src="images/capE.jpg" width="100" height="160" alt="E" title="E" />
</div><p class="dropcap">dward Sherman was still where we
left him, listening graciously to the pretended
good wishes of Hank Glutter,
when Dr. Goodrich, who happened to pass
that way, saw him through the window and
beckoned him out side.</p>

<p>"I expected to have met you at Dr. DeWolf's,"
said he, "and I brought a letter for
you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>Edward took the letter and read it carefully
through, turning very pale as he did so.
It was from his sister Louise, and contained
a brief account of the dangerous illness of his
mother, with a request for his immediate presence
at home. His extreme paleness and the
trembling hand, with which he in silence offered
the open sheet for the Doctor's persual
were all the outward sign of his soul's agony;
agony for a beloved and dying mother; agony
for the beloved, lost one, for whom, in company
with a few friends, he was about to go
in quest.</p>

<p>While the Doctor was running over the communication,
Edward tried to calm the surging
tempest within, sufficiently to decide him
how to act.</p>

<p>"Doctor," said he, "I must go to mother,
can you, I know it will be difficult, but <i>can</i> you
take my place in the company to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I will go, and, by the love I bear your
sister, I promise to do what I can."</p>

<p>"Let me hear from you by mail," said Edward,
wringing his hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>Edward had now barely time to return to
Pendleton, and hastily get his trunk in readiness
for the forthcoming steamer.</p>

<p>At the sound of the bell he was ready to
embark and a few days rapid travelling
brought him worn and weary to the old homestead.
It was evening when he arrived, and,
as he approached the house, he saw a light in
his mother's room. His apprehensions were
so great that he had not the courage to enter,
and, listening near the window, he distinguished
his mother's voice in conversation
with Louise.</p>

<p>"I would not be surprised to see him this
very evening," he heard his sister say.</p>

<p>"Miss Louise," called out Recta's familiar
voice. "Miss Louise, won't you please come
here quick. Old Spot has got into the front
yard; there she is nibbling at that rose bush
under the window. I can't see nothing but
the white spot in her face; but I know it
must be her, she's such an unruly critter;
won't you just hold the light while I hist her
out?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>"O where's Lilly Foot," said Louise,
"she'll drive her out while you open the gate.
Here, Lilly Foot."</p>

<p>Lilly Foot came growling along from the
vicinity of the barn, where, after the fatigue
of bringing the cows from the distant meadow,
she had gone to rest and recruit for night
watching.</p>

<p>Having forgotten at the beginning of our
story to introduce Lilly Foot under the family
head we will pause for a moment and give
her the notice to which her position and worth
entitle her. She was a very respectable looking
animal of the canine species originally
coal black with the exception of one white
foot, from which she derived her name, but
now grown grey in the service of the family.</p>

<p>From puppyhood to old age, this faithful
creature had made it her daily business to
keep the cows, sheep, pigs, and poultry each
in their proper places, and, having been raised
on a quiet, orderly New England farm, had
never in the course of her whole life, had occasion
to perform more onerous nightly duties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
than to sleep with one eye open; consequently,
she had come to consider regular rest as
her lawful right, and was in no mood to bear
the present encroachment.</p>

<p>"I believe the dog is getting old and cross,"
said Recta in a voice very like that which had
occasioned her censure. "Here Lilly Foot,
there's Old Spot; take her."</p>

<p>The words had scarcely left Recta's lips before
Lilly Foot saw and flew violently at the
object indicated,</p>

<p>"Lilly Foot."</p>

<p>They all heard&mdash;Edward's voice that came
from the rose bush, and it would be difficult
to say from which of the three, Louise, Recta,
or Lilly Foot, he received the warmest greeting.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sherman had passed the crisis, of her
disease, and Edward, assured of her convalesence,
sought her bedside with a buoyant
step.</p>

<p>"My dear son, to have you here is all the
medicine I need now," she said, as she held
him to her bosom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>The first greetings over, Edward's unnatural
strength produced by anxiety and excitement
gave way, and he lay down to rest that
night prostrated in body and mind.</p>

<p>Confused images of his mother, Little
Wolf, and Bloody Jim crowded his unquiet
dreams, and he awoke in the morning comparatively
unrefreshed, and the old load in
his bosom but little lightened. Soon after
breakfast he signified his intention of riding
over to the Post Office, two miles distant.</p>

<p>"O no," said his sister playfully, "mother
will be disappointed; she expects to have you
all to herself this morning. I made it a point
to go for the mail every day until she was
taken sick. Let me go this time, I really
need a horseback ride. If I get a letter for
you, you shall have it in just fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>"From now?"</p>

<p>"No; from the time I get it."</p>

<p>"I am overruled," laughed Edward, and
he went to his mother's room. Scarcely had
he seated himself when Mrs. Sherman enquired,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>"Has Dr. DeWolf's daughter been found
yet, Edward?"</p>

<p>"No, mother."</p>

<p>"How dreadful! Dr. Goodrich said in his
last letter he had but little hope of seeing her
alive. I was gratified to hear that you were
in pursuit, and that you were situated so you
could do your father's old friend a favor. I
wish you would tell me the particulars of the
sad affair."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sherman wondered at Edward's prolonged
silence, as he sat there utterly unable
to say a word. She was beginning to have a
vague conception of the truth, when he turned
to her and said in a voice which the effort
to control rendered scarcely audible.</p>

<p>"Mother, I expected to have made Miss
De Wolf my wife. I can not talk about it
now."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Sherman led him gently on by
means which true mothers know so well how
to use, to unburden his heart, and ere long
her sympathy ran so high as to propose that
he should return to Minnesota, and if need<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
he should return to Minnesota, and if need
be spend the winter there.</p>

<p>"If I could take you and Louise with me,"
said he.</p>

<p>Just then Louise came, in high spirits.</p>

<p>"O mother," said she, "you must hurry
and get well in time to attend Maria Dole's
wedding. I met her going to shop. She
wants me to be one of her bridesmaids. Now
guess who she is going to marry; but of
course you'd never guess for you are not acquainted
with the gentleman; so I may as
well toll you at once; John Hanford, from the
wilds of Minnesota. Maria says she is afraid
of being carried off by the bears, but still too
willing to venture a home in the woods for
her dear Johnny's sake. I did not tell her
about Dr. DeWolf's daughter, I was afraid it
would stop the wedding, Maria is such a timid
creature. Brother, do tell me about that horrible
affair."</p>

<p>"Tell her mother," said Edward and immediately
left the room.</p>

<p>While Mrs. Sherman was explaining the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
matter, Edward was walking up and down
the lawn in front of the house, vainly considering
the probabilities of a favorable termination
of his troubles.</p>

<p>"What can we do for poor Edward?" said
Louise, after a long silence, "I think he
ought to go back."</p>

<p>"He was saying when you came in if he
could only take you and me."</p>

<p>"Well why not?" said Louise eagerly, "I
am sure if you keep on getting well as rapidly
as you have for a few days you'll be about
the house in a week."</p>

<p>"When we hear from Dr. Goodrich, my
dear, we shall be better able to decide what
is best for us to do."</p>

<p>"Then all we can do is to wait in patience."</p>

<p>Wait they did for over a week before the
looked-for intelligence arrived, and the following
is the contents of Dr. Goodrich's letter.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sherman.</span> All our efforts have
proved unavailing. We could not find the
least clue to aid us in our search. I am now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
inclined to think that Miss DeWolf has voluntarily
secreted herself until such times as
she hopes to return unmolested by Bloody
Jim, whom, if my conjectures are correct, she
no doubt thinks still at large. As for Bloody
Jim his lips are forever closed. In attempting
to escape from prison last evening he was
shot dead.</p>

<p>I learn with pleasure from your letter
which I have just received, that your mother's
health is rapidly improving. Take courage
Ned, the same hand that restored one
loved one can also restore the other. You
say you must return. Why not bring your
mother and sister with you? A change of
climate would no doubt benefit both. I think
there will be time for you to come before
navigation closes. The weather continues
splendid. I am now at Dr. DeWolf's. He
is worse again; I think he cannot last long.
He is literally drinking himself to death.
Mrs. Hawley still attends on him. Sorrel Top
and daddy do not get along very well together,
but between them the Doctor's house is
well cared for.</p>

<p>If it will be any comfort to you I will say
that I have sanguine expectations of again
seeing Miss DeWolf safe at home,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>Yours with more sympathy than I can express.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">G. Goodrich</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>Louise received a letter from the same hand,
but it being an entirely private affair we can
only speculate upon its contents. Doubtless
among other things there were unanswerable
arguments in favor of a western trip, for
when the reading was over, she was the first
one to say.</p>

<p>"I think we had all better get ready as
soon as we can and start for Minnesota."</p>

<p>Edward being of the same mind, and Mrs.
Sherman willing to gratify her children, it
was not many days before the arrangments
were all made for the journey. Recta and
Lilly Foot were to be left in sole charge of the
house; the tenant having promised the assistance
of one of his sons when required.</p>

<p>The wedding ceremony of John Hanford
and Maria Dole having been performed the
evening previous to their departure, they
traveled in company with the bridal pair.</p>

<p>Maria Dole was the only daughter of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
neighboring farmer, and the two girls had
from childhood been on intimate terms, and
Louise had hoped some day to call her sister;
but she loved the gentle girl none the less for
the step she had taken, and Edward's regard
for her seemed to have suddenly increased.
The conduct of her husband who was a bashful
soul, exceedingly shy, and sparing of his
husbandly attentions, gave Edward frequent
opportunities during their trip of cultivating
a more familiar acquaintance with her than
he had ever imagined possible.</p>

<p>"Some women appear to better advantage
after marriage and Maria Dole is one of them,"
he said in a very decided manner to his sister
after having been engaged in a long conversation
with the newly-made wife. "She can
converse now and she never could before."</p>

<p>"Yon mean, brother, you were afraid of
each other before. It was my fault; you both
knew what my wishes were, and it spoiled all.
To have carried out the romance of the thing,
you ought to have discovered her perfections
before it was too late."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>Louise quite forgot for the moment her
brother's affliction, but on second thought said
no more.</p>

<p>"I am sorry Mr. Hanford is going to take
her so far from any settlement," said Edward,
not appearing to notice what had been said,
"he tells me his nearest neighbor is ten miles
distant."</p>

<p>"How lonely Maria will be, I'm glad we
are all to visit her in the Spring," said Louise,
alluding to a promise made to that effect.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hanford rather insists upon my going
out with them now, but I could not promise
until I had seen the Doctor. If I decide to
go I can overtake him by the next steamer,
as he will stop for a day or two at St. Paul."</p>

<p>The next day after the above conversation,
the party having arrived at Pendleton, separated;
Mr. and Mrs. Hanford continuing up
the river to the head of navigation, while the
Sherman family were introduced to comfortable
quarters provided by the forethought of
Dr. Goodrich.</p>

<p>By the advice of his friends, who plainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
saw, that under the circumstances, he could
not content himself to remain where he was,
Edward decided to join Mr. Hanford at St.
Paul, and the following chapter will chronicle
the result.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<div class="chaphead"><p><b>Rough Roads&mdash;the Happy Bridegroom&mdash;Jacob

<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/capT.jpg" width="100" height="160" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p class="dropcap">he prospect of a change from steamboat
navigation, always so delightful on
the upper Mississippi, to jolting and
jarring over a rough extent of country in a
heavy, lumbering wagon, suited to the unimproved
state of the roads, was anything but
agreeable to Mr. and Mrs. Hanford, as they
surveyed the uncomely vehicle drawn up before
their hotel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>Edward had overtaken them, and with Mr.
and Mrs. Hanford, stood waiting on the porch,
while Mr. Hanford made every arrangement
for their comfort, of which the state of the
case would admit. The cushions and buffalos
at length fixed to his satisfaction he assisted
in his wife, and after a small strife, in
which each contended for the seat which
neither wanted, Edward prevailed, and planted
himself beside the driver, while Mr. Hanford,
looking remarkably happy for a vanquished
man, took his place beside his wife.</p>

<p>The sober driver, Jacob Mentor by name,
looked over his shoulder and carefully surveyed
his load before starting. The trunks
were firmly strapped on behind, and a half a
dozen chairs were also disposed of in the
same way. A small sized dining table, bed
downward, rested behind the seats, so hugged
up by boxes and bundles, that it appeared
impossible for any number of bumps or
thumps to disturb its quiet. The two beaming
faces, just in the van of all this array, did
not escape the eyes of honest Jacob.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess yer pretty comfortable to start
on," said he.</p>

<p>"All right," said Mr. Hanford, "drive on."</p>

<p>It would be a matter of surprise how it had
entered into the head of a plain, common-sense,
matter-of-fact young man like John
Hanford, to bestow the name of "Fairy
Knoll" on the little hillock in the wilderness,
where stood his solitary cabin, did we not remember
that at the time he was completely
under love's influence. The name given under
such circumstances was music to him as
it fell frequently from the lips of his young
bride on their toilsome journey thither.</p>

<p>"I hope the fairies at Fairy Knoll will have
a nice fire to welcome us, she said, as the day
was drawing to a close, and they were nearing
her future home.</p>

<p>"Are you very cold?" said her husband,
drawing her more closely to his side.</p>

<p>The day had been unusually chilly, and
towards night the autumn winds got up a
boisterous frolic, and swept past, dashing from
their wings light flurries of snow directly in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the faces of our travelers, and the delicate
bride, unused to such rough play, had at last
hid her face behind her veil and wished for
the warm fireside. Before she had had time
to reply to Mr. Hanford's question, Edward
produced a neat little flask encased in silver,
and unfastening from the stopper a tiny cup
of the same make, he filled it with the sparkling
fluid, at the same time giving orders for
the wagon to stop.</p>

<p>"Now here is something almost equal to a
warm fire," he said offering Mrs. Hanford the
cup.</p>

<p>"What is it?" said she, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Pure domestic wine, some of Col. Wilson's
best, ho presented it to me just before I left
home, and gave me his word it was unadulterated,"
said Edward, with great assurance.</p>

<p>"Col. Wilson's wines are justly popular,"
said Mrs. Hanford, sipping the beverage; but
it is whispered that the Colonel uses alcohol in
their preparation."</p>

<p>"O, very likely," said Edward carelessly.
"I have no doubt of it, but this he assured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
me was unadulterated. Have some, Mr.
Hanford?"</p>

<p>"I don't care if I do. It is really very
fine," he said, returning the cup, "quite stimulating,
but I prefer a little brandy to any
other stimulant; it takes right hold."</p>

<p>"You surely don't drink brandy!" exclamed
the young wife, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Only a little, occasionally, when I need it
to keep the cold out. O never fear, my
dear," he continued observing the look of
concern upon his wife's countenance. "I'm
a good temperance man, but not a teetotaler;
that is drawing the reins rather too tight."</p>

<p>Meantime, Edward had offered the driver
a drink, but the man shook his head; "No,
thank you," said he, "I'd rather not take
any."</p>

<p>"Not take any!" said Edward, "why, sir,
it will do you good."</p>

<p>"I'm not sick," said the other.</p>

<p>"But you are cold," said Edward, mistaking
his modest demeanor for bashfulness.</p>

<p>But the earnest and decided shake of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
head by which he refused the second invitation,
signified more than words that he was
an adherent of the total abstinence principles.</p>

<p>"What a simpleton," said Edward to himself,
as the individual by his side shiveringly
gathered up the reins and drove on.</p>

<p>But the individual's ruminations were of
quite a different character, and something after
this wise: "Shiver away, old man, it is
better to shiver than to drink." Be it known
that for many years this grey headed man had
without measure, poured down the alcoholic
fire. When at length overcome by it, a good
Samaritan had discovered him lying sick by
the wayside, and had humanely assisted him
to rise, and had set him upon the beast commonly
known as "Total Abstinence," upon
which he had ridden with great comfort and
safety up to the time of our story. Moreover
being satisfied that the animal was of good
parts and <i>sure-footed</i>, he was not at all inclined
to exchange the faithful old creature
for any of the best bloods belonging to the
domestic wine family. He had not forgotten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
that apparently harmless little hobby-horse
whose <i>cognomen</i> was Lager Beer, which he
had sported in his youth, but which at last
got unruly; whether from having been stabled
with vicious beasts, or from a bad quality
which it inherently possessed, he was not
in a condition to inquire the first time it played
off its pranks upon him. But one thing
was certain, after several months of docile behavior,
one fine morning his pet landed him
very unceremoniously in the gutter, after
which, on various occasions, he mounted nearly
all the beasts in the stable, whiskey, rum,
brandy, etc., but they, one and all, proved
vastly more refractory than the first named,
and, as we have seen, he was at length left
battered and bruised by the way side.</p>

<p>It is needless to state that Jacob Mentor's
experience had not, nor was it likely to benefit
any so much as himself; for who, among
the thousands tampering with stimulating
drinks, could be made to believe that a glass
of beer, or an occasional sip of wine would
result in their final overthow?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>Such, at all events, was not the opinion of
our young friends journeying in the direction
of "Fairy Knoll; for more than once the
wine went round as the night winds whistled
colder. But the tedious road had at length
an end, and about dark, the heavy wagon
lumbered up under the shadows of Fairy
Knoll.</p>

<p>"It won't do to drive up that hill with this
heavy load, the horses are too much jaded,"
said Jacob.</p>

<p>"Then we'll walk up," said Mr. Hanford,
jumping out. "Come now, Mrs. Hanford,"
proudly stretching out his arms, "I will carry
you up. Mr. Sherman follow me; the path
is a little slippery, and we shall have to step
carefully."</p>

<p>By reason of his burden and the icy path,
Mr. Hanford was sometime in reaching his
cabin, but he made short work of getting inside;
for, having bestowed several impatient
thumps upon the window which he declared
frozen down, he suddenly threw himself
against the door, and crack went the wooden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
fastening, and open flew the door, and a most
unexpected scene burst upon his astonished
vision.</p>

<p>Surely here were the fairies, and here the
warm fire for which his shivering little wife
had been wishing. Surprise held him upon
the threshold; but Edward, who instantly
recognized in one of the so-called fairies, the
person of Little Wolf, sprang forward with a
shout of joy.</p>

<p>"The honey, sure as I'm alive," cried Jacob
Mentor, pressing eagerly after him. "Laws,"
said he, precipitately dropping his bundles in
the middle of the floor, and rushing up to Edward,
"how came the little creature here?"</p>

<p>Edward silently held the little creature in
his arms as if he would keep back the dear
life that appeared leaving her, and when Jacob's
eye fell upon the white, upturned face,
he drew back with a look of alarm.</p>

<p>When this and that restorative had been
resorted to with happy effect, and Little Wolf
no longer required undivided attention, at her
suggestion Antoinette La Clare briefly relat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>ed
the story of their escape from Bloody Jim.
Mutual explanations followed, discovering to
Antoinette the fact, that she had taken refuge
in the house of her cousin, for such John
Hanford proved to be, his mother's sister having
married Antoinette's father.</p>

<p>Amid the general rejoicings and congratulations,
Edward naturally alluded to the death
of Bloody Jim, and the means by which it
was accomplished. "We are fairly rid of him
now," he said, turning to Little Wolf, who
had quietly slipped from his embrace and
perched herself upon the big chest, "the ball
made sure work."</p>

<p>The color had come to her cheek, and there
was great joy in her eye, but Edward's unlucky
words made her pale again, and she
looked quickly and apprehensively towards
Antoinette.</p>

<p>The poor girl shiveringly hid her face in
her hands and sobbed audibly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<div class="chaphead"><p><b>Busy Preparations and the Climax&mdash;The
Lovers&mdash;Tom Tinknor's Discovery&mdash;General
Rejoicings&mdash;The Idol Defaced.</b></p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/capT.jpg" width="100" height="160" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p class="dropcap">he next morning the cottage on the
knoll presented a scene of busy preparation,
the climax of which brought forth
Little Wolf rosy, and roguish, wrapped in
blankets and shawls, sufficient, we doubt not,
to have covered over more land than the
nether garments of the famous Ten Breeches.</p>

<p>She was now in readiness for her homeward
journey. The long-wished-for time had
come, and with it, ten thousand joyous emo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>tions,
which, amid all the changes of after
life, she never forgot. Her heart had put
forth its life flower, and who ever forgot a
like season of bloom.</p>

<p>Edward was here, there, and everywhere,
arranging for her comfort, and he looked very
proud indeed when he handed, or rather lifted
the lady in blankets into the big wagon,
and took his seat beside her.</p>

<p>They were to go alone, Antoinette having
accepted a pressing invitation to remain with
her newly-found cousins. The driver of the
day before did not, as on a previous occasion,
wait for orders. Before the adieus were fairly
spoken he cracked his whip and drove off
at a rate, which, in his cooler moments, he
would have pronounced absolutely ruinous to
his carefully preserved establishment. The
fact that said establishment comprised all the
earthly possessions of honest Jacob, was of itself
a sufficient guarantee for the safe transportation
of his employers. But when added
to this was a natural cautiousness and benevolence
of disposition, which could not but be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
observed on the most casual acquaintance,
few could have lost their assurance, even on
the verge of a precipice, when he held the
reins.</p>

<p>His extreme caution made him a favorite
teamster, not only overland, but especially on
the Mississippi; when at certain seasons there
was danger in travelling on the ice. At such
times, Squire Tinknor and Dr. DeWolf had
taken some pains to secure his services, when
exchanging family visits, and he had frequently
been entrusted with the sole charge of
Little Wolf, when she was but a child, and
delighted with the long icy trip.</p>

<p>In those days, the little lady had completely
won the heart of her protector, and he had
never before had occasion to be jealous of attentions
which she was pleased to receive
from any of her friends, except, indeed, when
Daddy would sometimes infringe upon his
rights, by officiously lifting her in and out of
his sleigh. Nor could he be said to be jealous
now. It was only the same disagreeable sensation
which affectionate sisters sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
experience on the occasion of the marriage of
a favorite brother. Had Jacob been questioned
on the subject, he would have stoutly
declared that he was glad of it; for that was
just what he tried to say to himself, when he
saw Edward put his dearly beloved pet into
the wagon. But even his fine horses, which
he hurried off with such unseemly haste,
ought to have known it was not so.</p>

<p>"Why, what has got into the man? he has
almost taken your breath away," said Edward
tenderly.</p>

<p>"A little more careful, sir," he said, as Jacob
turned his head at his loud exclamation.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; I beg pardon, I was careless."</p>

<p>The speaker was evidently ashamed of his
freak. A second look at the happy couple,
and a kind word from his pet, "Dear Jacob,
I believe old Grey and Bill remember how I
used to want to go fast when we went so
much together," soothed his turbulent feelings
and he went on quite slowly, picking up
some crumbs of comfort in default of the
whole loaf.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>The loaf, be it remembered, had fallen into
the hands of the voracious couple just behind
him, and if greedily devouring it during the
entire day would have made a finish of it, the
deed would have been done. But the more
they fed on it, the larger and sweeter it grew,
and, by the time they had arrived at Squire
Tinknor's, their loaf had grown to be almost
as much as they could carry.</p>

<p>Squire Tinknor, it will be remembered, was
an old acquaintance of Dr. DeWolf, and, as
we have elsewhere stated, the two gentlemen
were on intimate terms. Having at one time
been his partner in some extensive land speculations,
the Squire had, since that period,
acted as the doctor's financial agent and advisor.
He was generally shrewd and reliable
in his business transactions, although his appetite
for drink occasionally got the better of
his judgment. This known discrepancy of
character was tolerated in society rather as an
amiable weakness, than a vile habit, for none
had the hardihood to frown openly upon a
man of Squire Tinknor's wealth and position.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>His family consisted of a wife and one son.
The latter, a handsome, dashing young man,
he had secretly desired to see attracted
towards the daughter of his friend, and in
this had not been disappointed. Thomas
Tinknor had, from a boy, bestowed his choicest
attentions upon the young lady, and when
she was carried off, he had sworn to bring her
back, or "die in the attempt." To this end
he had faithfully mounted his horse each day
since her disappearance, and had ridden several
miles into the woods, always going out in
high spirits, and returning somewhat dejected.</p>

<p>It was in this condition that he might have
been seen approaching his father's house just
as Jacob Mentor drew up before the gate.
His heart beat quickly, for he instantly recognized
the toss of that little head, enveloped
as it was in hood and veil. He was not
slow in extending to Little Wolf a warm welcome.
So warm indeed, was it, and of such
vapory stuff is comfort made, that Edward's
ponderous loaf evaporated, leaving only a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
small fragment such as could be drawn from
a stolen glance of the eye, while she was being
carried into the house, and transported
from the arms of Mr. Tinknor the younger, to
the arms of Mr. Tinknor the elder, and lastly,
affectionately folded in the embrace of Mrs.
Tinknor.</p>

<p>"You see everything I have on is borrowed,"
said Little wolf, as Mrs. Tinknor was assisting
her in undoing her wrappings, "but I
hope to be at home in a day or two."</p>

<p>"Home in a day or two!" interrupted Tom,
"Not in a month or two, if I can prevent it."</p>

<p>"I intend to be at home to-morrow, provided
the steamers are still running," said the
young lady decidedly.</p>

<p>"O, now, you are too bad to treat us so
shabbily," said Tom, coaxingly, "do stay until
the river freezes, and I'll take you down
on the ice."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Tinknor, I must go to-morrow."</p>

<p>Tom Tinknor, knew from past experience
that to attempt further persuasion was entire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>ly
useless, and he said no more, silently indulging
the hope that the ice would blockade
the river before morning. His desires were
in part gratified. The next day it was ascertained
that no steamers would venture forth
among the floating ice cakes, and Tom was
exultant.</p>

<p>In this mood he determined to give Little
Wolf a surprise party, and thus alleviate, in
some degree her disappointment. His parents
heartily co-operated in his project, and the
trio immediately set about making preparations
for the entertainment of a large circle of
friends.</p>

<p>It was decided that Edward should be initiated
into the secret, and the task of hoodwinking
their prying and discontented young
guest, was assigned to him. By ways and
means known only to a masterly hand, Edward
contrived on that eventful day to perform
the feat, in which, no doubt, the whole
Tinknor family combined would have failed.</p>

<p>For when evening came on, and the company
were assembled, Little Wolf most un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>expectedly
found herself in the midst, an object
of universal interest. A more beautiful
object could scarce have been found. At all
events, so thought Edward Sherman, as he
mingled in the throng, great billows of gladness
surging in his soul. His cup of joy was
large and full. He was holding it with a
firm hand, and he said in his heart, "I shall
never be moved."</p>

<p>The evening was drawing to a close, but
the feasting and toasting was still kept up.
The wine went round, and the adventures of
our heroine continued to be commemorated
in appropriate sentiments. While the guests
still lingered, a shade of anxiety might occasionally
be traced on many a fair face, as husband
or brother, or "that other," exhibited
unmistakable signs of an overheated brain.</p>

<p>Little Wolfs cheek grew pale, as from time
to time she observed the rising flush on Edward's
brow. He was exceedingly susceptible
to the use of stimulants, and was rapidly
thrown into a highly exhilarated condition,
making him for a time brilliant, but finally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
entangling his talk in a labyrinth of meaningless
and silly words. When in the latter
condition which was not observable until just
before the party broke up, he conceived the
unlucky idea of urging upon Little Wolf a
glass of his favorite drink. "Permit me,"
said he, stepping, or rather swaggering up to
where the lady stood, "to&mdash;to&mdash;," and suddenly
appearing to notice the extreme pallor
that overspread her countenance, he stammered,
"to bring the blushes to those cheeks."</p>

<p>It was enough. The heart at once threw
its crimson mantle upon her face, but alas! it
was dyed in shame. Poor Little Wolf had
no words at command. There, before her,
stood the man in whom, a few hours before
she had felt so much pride and confidence.
Her heart's best feelings had gone out to him,
and here was her idol horribly defaced, and
he knew it not. He even held invitingly towards
her the instrument that had done the
mischief, and, while the cup still shook in his
trembling hand, he began to wonder at her
silence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>She once or twice moved her lips, as if to
speak, but the words died away. She was
not faint or weak, but was for the moment
paralyzed. When the quick reaction came,
on fire with indignation she acted with characteristic
energy and decision, and all heard
the crash of the goblet, as with one rapid
sweep of her little hand she dashed it to the
floor, and fled from the room.</p>

<p>Did she forgive him? She said in her
heart she would not.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<div class="chaphead"><p><b>Painful Recollections&mdash;The Last Boat
of the Season&mdash;Ruffled Plumes&mdash;Reconciliation.</b></p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 140px;">
<img src="images/capW.jpg" width="140" height="160" alt="W" title="W" />
</div><p class="dropcap">hen Little Wolf awoke the next
morning, her mind instantly reverted
to the painful subject, that had banished
sleep from her eyes the greater part of
the night, and, as the shameful scene came
up again vividly before her, she buried her
face in her pillow and groaned aloud. While
thus indulging afresh her grief and mortification,
she was aroused by a sound which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
turned her thoughts in another direction.
She started up eagerly and threw open the
window which commanded an extended view
of the river, and, in the distance, she could
just discern through the fast falling snow, a
brave little steamer, as if by magic ploughing
its way up through snow and ice.</p>

<p>Little Wolf hung out of the window half
in fear lest the welcome vision should vanish;
but it kept steadily onward, drawing nearer
and nearer to its destination, and soon she
had the satisfaction of seeing it safely moored,
and, by the active discharge of freight, it was
evident that it would attempt a downward
trip.</p>

<p>The thought of home banished every other
from her mind, and she hastily drew inside
and shook the white flakes from her glossy
hair, and began to arrange them in curls.
But the unruly locks had blown about so
long in the wind, and got so cold and tangled
and required so much coaxing and brushing,
that Little Wolf began to despair of ever
getting them in order.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then she observed on the dresser a
bottle of what she supposed to be pomatum,
but in reality, a mixture for the lungs, made
of honey and other ingredients, which by
exposure to the cold had partially congealed.
She caught it up and literally saturated her
hair in the contents and then with great spirit
proceeded to her task.</p>

<p>At the first onset the brush stuck fast;
"Dear me what ails it?" she ejaculated
throwing down the brush and making desperate
dives with a coarse tooth comb.</p>

<p>By this time her pretty tangled ringlets had
stiffened into a striking resemblance to cork
screws interspersed with porcupine quills.
By a succession of impatient jerks she endeavored
to bring the wayward mass to submission;
but the more she attempted to separate
and arrange, the closer the loving locks
embraced each other, and she was beginning
to despair of conquering the difficulty, when
she heard a light knock and Mrs. Tinknor's
kind voice said "May I come in?"</p>

<p>"O dear, yes," said Little Wolf, springing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
to the door, "do come in, my dear Mrs. Tinknor,
and tell me what this horrid pomade is
made of."</p>

<p>"Why, dear child, what have you been
doing to yourself? your hair looks as if ten
thousand furies had been tearing it."</p>

<p>"O Mrs. Tinknor, it is this horrid pomade."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tinknor's eye fell upon the offending
preparation. "Why, bless your heart my
child," she exclaimed in dismay, "you have
been using Aunt Betsy's cough medicine."</p>

<p>Little Wolf threw herself on the bed convulsed
with laughter, and Mrs. Tinknor heartily
joined in the merry peals.</p>

<p>"I came to tell you," said Mrs. Tinknor,
when somewhat composed, "that a steamer
has just arrived, and Mr. Tinknor and Tom
have gone out to ascertain when she will
return, if at all.</p>

<p>"O, I know she's going back right away,"
said Little Wolf springing up. "I saw them
hurrying off the freight; O dear, what shall
I do with my hair?" She was beginning to
feel too anxious to laugh now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come to my room, dear, it is warmer there
and I can soon wash it out for you. Now
put this shawl around you; never mind dressing,
we have the house all to ourselves you know."</p>

<p>"Suppose I were to get caught in this ridiculous
plight," said Little Wolf, pushing her
feet into her slippers, "I wouldn't have Tom
see me for the world."</p>

<p>"Then run along quickly and make sure,"
said Mrs. Tinknor, laughingly, "I think we
needn't feel concerned about the gentlemen
coming back for half an hour," she added, as
Little Wolf ran on before.</p>

<p>Now the gentlemen had already returned,
bringing Edward with them. The latter,
having forstalled them at the boat, met them
as he was hurrying to Little Wolf with the
necessary information. On coming in they
unluckily took possession of the very room
through which the ladies would pass in order
to reach Mrs. Tinknor's apartment.</p>

<p>Reassured by her hostess, Little Wolf
pushed confidently forward, making bold and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
decisive charges at the obstructing doors,
and in this manner, made her way directly
into the presence of the two young gentlemen,
Mr. Tinknor having gone in search of his wife.</p>

<p>Here she was brought to a sudden stand,
but it was only for an instant, for Little Wolf,
like a true womanly general, was skilled in
retreat when caught in rumpled uniform.
She turned and darted through the door
which stood accommodatingly open, and although
Edward's suppressed smile, and Tom's
uproarious laugh, goaded her on, she stopped
long enough to lock them in, thus cutting off
pursuit which Tom evidently meditated; he
having, in consideration of their long and intimate
acquaintance, felt himself warranted
in chasing after her, and was at her heels,
when he suddenly found himself a prisoner.</p>

<p>"O Wolf, Wolf, he shouted, pounding upon
the door, "the boat, the boat, she'll leave"&mdash;</p>

<p>"When will she leave?" said Little Wolf, stopping short.</p>

<p>"Let me out and I'll tell you, come, be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
quick, there's no time to be lost. If you
want to go here's Mr. Sherman to take charge
of you."</p>

<p>"I can take care of myself," muttered
Little Wolf, but, while she paused she had
additional cause for mortification; for Squire
Tinknor had found his way to his wife, and
her only refuge was behind Mrs. Tinknor's
flowing skirts. Here she partially screened
herself, while he informed them that the boat
would attempt a downward trip in the course
of an hour. "Ha, ha, ha," concluded the
Squire, "if sis is bent on going, she must
make haste out of that plight."</p>

<p>By the united efforts of her friends, Little
Wolf took passage for Chimney Rock, and
Edward, looking very handsome and self-possessed,
acted as her escort.</p>

<p>Without explanation, without apology,
without so much as a look of contrition from
her travelling companion, at the first interview
Little Wolf forgave all the pain and
mortification he had made her feel. She
had forgiven him without knowing it. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
thought herself still angry because her heart
ached.</p>

<p>Edward was surprised. He had expected
to meet indignant looks, and perhaps reproachful
words; he had feared even worse, for he
well knew the decision that marked Little
Wolf's forming character, and he had armed
himself to meet the treatment which he felt
he justly merited. But his chosen weapon
of defense was pride and so was useless when
opposed to Little Wolf's unusual gentleness.
He was subdued, and when man's proud
spirit is once subdued by the forbearance of
the woman he loves, that woman henceforth
becomes to him an object of adoration.</p>

<p>Edward had the day before called Little
Wolf, darling, now he called her angel, and
before he parted from her he had said "my
angel," and she had smiled upon him when
he said it.</p>

for New Year's Day&mdash;A Discussion.</b></p></div>

</div><p class="dropcap">inter had fairly set in. The December
winds had for several weeks,
blown upon the "Father of Waters,"
and he slept like a huge giant, all unmindful
of the western breezes which came to fetter
and play their pranks upon him. Many wild
revelries did those winged sprites hold upon
his grim visage, and many a day did the
pleasure loving inhabitants of the lively village
of Pendleton go forth and join the grand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
revel. On such occasions the newly made
playground resounded with merry shouts and
tinkling bells, for there skating and sleigh-riding
and other winter sports were brought
to perfection.</p>

<p>Our young friends of the "Bay State"
were quite at home amid such scenes, and
nearly every day, might be seen dashing
up before their hotel, a fanciful little sleigh
drawn by a fine spirited grey, who chafed
and stamped, and shook his necklace of silver
bells, as if to signal the fair lady, whose coming
he so impatiently waited. His temper,
however, was seldom severely tested, for it
was Dr. Goodrich who sported this elegant
little establishment, and Louise Sherman well
knew at what hour of the day to be in readiness
for a ride.</p>

<p>Occasionally the duties of his profession
detained the doctor beyond his usual time,
and then came Louise's turn to feel the least
bit in the world uneasy and anxious. But
one day there was a delay of the kind which
passed apparently unheeded by her. She had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
as usual brought out her little fur cap with
its red ribbon ties and deposited it with her
gloves upon the table, and having arranged
her mantle near the fire, and put her overshoes
in a warm place upon the hearth, she
seated herself by the window, just opposite
her mother who has taking her afternoon nap
in an easy chair. Here she sat for some time
anxiously watching the sleeper, and evidently
waiting for her to awaken. At length
Mrs. Sherman opened her eyes, and, as she
caught Louise's eager glance gave a little
start. "Hasn't the doctor come yet?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"No mother, but I'm all ready, and I'm
glad you are awake, for I wanted to tell you
before I left, that Edward had ordered wine
for New Year's, and he said if it came while
he was out, he wished it put in his private
room."</p>

<p>"Wine for New Year's! exclaimed Mrs.
Sherman in unfeigned astonishment.</p>

<p>"Why yes, mother, Edward says our friends
will expect it of us."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"I cannot consent to it," said Mrs. Sherman
decidedly, "we shall have a plentiful
supply of refreshments, and, Louise, I'm surprised
that you should, in the remotest manner,
give your sanction to your brother's foolish
proposal."</p>

<p>"But, mother, said Louise, eagerly, "Edward
says that it is pure domestic wine, and
I don't see what harm that can do."</p>

<p>"It was pure domestic wine that made
Noah drunk, my dear."</p>

<p>"O dear," said Louise rather impatiently,
"I wish old Noah had never got drunk, if"&mdash;</p>

<p>Just then she happened to glance out of
the window, and saw the doctor drive up,
and consequently her frowns and Noah's sins
were burried in oblivion, and a smile and a
blush bloomed upon their tomb.</p>

<p>Louise had just done tying on her cap when
the doctor appeared at the door, and, while
he was exchanging civilities with her mother,
she slipped out and ran to her brother whom
she saw coming in the passage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>"We can't have it Ned," she whispered,
"mother has set her foot down."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Yes Ned, she has."</p>

<p>Edward frowned slightly, but said nothing,
for by that time, the doctor was hastening his
sister away and his mother was gently calling
him.</p>

<p>"Edward."</p>

<p>"Yes mother," and, entering her room, he
threw himself carelessly into the seat which
Louise had vacated.</p>

<p>For a few moments both were silent, and
as the son looked into the mother's face, he
plainly saw that she was filled with grief and
anxiety; and his heart smote him for he really
loved and revered his mother; but he resolved
to appear as if he had observed nothing
amiss, and, taking his hat to leave, he
said quite cheerfully, "well mother what are
your commands?"</p>

<p>"Edward I have a request to make of you,"
replied Mrs. Sherman with some feeling in her
tone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>"Speak, mother dear," said he, falling
pleasantly into his seat.</p>

<p>"It is my request, Edward, that you do not
provide wine, or any other stimulant for our
New Year's entertainment."</p>

<p>"What, not coffee, mother?" said Edward
laughingly.</p>

<p>"You know very well what I mean," said
Mrs. Sherman with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"Of course it shall be as you wish," said
he more seriously, "but really, mother, I
think you are too strict. I am afraid our
friends will have a mean opinion of our hospitality."</p>

<p>"They will, of course, understand that we
are principled against the use of intoxicating
drinks.</p>

<p>"As a beverage," chimed in Edward with
a touch of irony in his tone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sherman looked hurt, and Edward repented
again. "Mother," said he, "forgive
me, I did not intend to wound you. Let us
drop a subject upon which we cannot agree.</p>

<p>"But, Edward, I cannot bear that we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
should differ. I have always endeavored to
instil correct principles into the minds of my
children, and now, just as they are on the
threshold of what might be a useful life, I
find the tares which an enemy had sown beginning
to spring up.</p>

<p>"But mother, you know I do not approve
of indulging to excess any more than you do.
It is only the total abstinence principles to
which I object, and even Louise says she can
see no harm in an occasional social glass."</p>

<p>"Does Miss DeWolf say the same," said
Mrs. Sherman fixing her eyes on Edward.</p>

<p>"I do not know, I am sure," replied Edward
nervously twirling his hat, "I have
never had any conversation with her on the
subject."</p>

<p>"Miss DeWolf is orthodox, I am prepared
to testify," exclaimed Louise, tripping into
the room, and, before any question could be
put as to the cause of her sudden return, she
gratuitously gave the information.</p>

<p>"A man had a fit or something," she said,
"and I must forsooth, lose my ride, for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
doctor's motto is business before pleasure; a
very good motto when I am not concerned,
but if the man could only have been taken
an hour or two later, it would have been a
great accommodation. However," and she
glanced archly at her brother, "I should then
have lost the opportunity of eavesdropping,
and consequently of giving in my testimony
in favor of my future sister-in-law."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I suppose you obtained your
information of my future brother-in-law."</p>

<p>"No matter how I got it, but I'm fully
prepared to prove that the young lady's principles
are severely 'touch not, taste not, handle
not.' We have a great work before us,
Ned, for they will not easily be persuaded to
our opinions I can assure you."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to influence my friends to
think just as I do," said Edward, proudly.</p>

<p>"Well, somehow you have managed to
make me think as you do, for you know I was
once as strict as mother."</p>

<p>"I hope you have not changed your views
on my account, Louise."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, not exactly, Ned, yet, I must confess,
your arguments have had great weight with
me."</p>

<p>"I would advise you to reconsider, and
think independently," said Edward rather
sharply.</p>

<p>Louise was silent, and Mrs. Sherman now
seized the opportunity to change the topic to
one more intimately connected with their future
plans and prospects. In this the attention
of the trio was absorbed until towards
evening, when they were interrupted by the
doctor's well known knock.</p>

<p>The doctor looked pale and worn, and, as
he seated himself, Edward remarked, "you
look tired doctor."</p>

<p>"Yes, I <i>am</i> tired," replied the doctor, "I
am tired of the world, or rather I am tired of
the way we are living in it. I have had an
aggravated case of delirium tremens on my
hands this afternoon, and I wish every liquor
seller in Pendleton could have looked in upon
that distressed family. A young and interesting
wife, and several small children<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
were compelled to witness a scene of suffering,
the horrors of which were truly appalling."</p>

<p>"It is strange," said Edward, "that men
will make such beasts of themselves."</p>

<p>"It is strange," said the doctor, "that if
men have no hearts of pity, that we can not
have laws to prevent the sale of the poison."</p>

<p>"But, doctor, men are not compelled to
buy it."</p>

<p>"But, Sherman, men <i>will</i> buy it, and will
drink it, the proof of which is before us every
day we live. These temperance societies are
no doubt most of them useful to society, but
they do not deal the death-blow to the monster.
Nothing but the law can do that. I
know your opinion, Sherman, but in the name
of humanity, what are we to do?"</p>

<p>"Why, doctor, we shall have to let men
kill themselves if they will be so foolish. We
cannot forbid the sale of pistols, because men
often use them for purposes of committing
suicide; and, even to suppose that a man is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
quite certain when he sells a deadly weapon
to another, that he will use it for the purpose
of self distruction, I hold that he has the legal
right to sell it; that he has no moral right
I readily admit."</p>

<p>"I do not understand law, Sherman; <i>perhaps</i>
our constitution is so framed that the
people have not the power to say whether or
not, our nation shall become a nation of
drunkards; perhaps the thousands of intelligent
men, who, heart-sick as I am this day in
view of the dreadful consequences accruing
from the sale of intoxicating drinks, have ignorantly
petitioned their state legislature for
a prohibitory law, which they had no power
to enact; perhaps those judges are correct
who have said their state can not have a law
that would restore peace and happiness to
thousands of families, whose sorrow it is too
harrowing to think upon. I say, <i>perhaps</i>, for,
I cannot but hope that judges who are equally
intelligent and who have told us differently
may not be mistaken. One thing is certain,
the hand of the liquor dealer must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
stayed, or in every house there will be one
dead."</p>

<p>"Public opinion might do much towards
accomplishing the desired object," suggested
Mrs. Sherman."</p>

<p>"True enough, Mrs. Sherman, said the
doctor, "but public opinion must have its
naps, and at best it is seldom half awake and
it requires an immoderate amount of force to
bring the sleepy thing to the right standpoint."</p>

<p>"Well, doctor, I am willing to use my little
strength in the cause, although I regret to
say that my efforts as far as my family are
concerned have proved entirely fruitless."</p>

<p>The doctor turned a surprised look towards
Louise, whose face was instantly suffused
with blushes.</p>

<img src="images/capH.jpg" width="110" height="160" alt="H" title="H" />
</div><p class="dropcap">oliday festivities and dancing parties
were words synonymous in the early
settlement of Minnesota, and, although
Mrs. Sherman would have been shocked at
the bare idea of her daughter attending a
public ball in her native village, the influences
of a new country so wrought upon her
prejudices, that her scruples gradually yielded;
and, when Louise rather doubtfully asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
permission to attend a party of the kind to be
given on New Year's Eve, she gained a reluctant
consent.</p>

<p>"I could not consent on any account,
Louise," said her mother with a view to excuse
this apparant departure from her principles,
"if I had not sometime ago had some
conversation with the doctor on the subject.
I have great confidence in his judgment, and,
I am sure he would not desire it, if it were
not a proper place for you. However, I have
my misgivings, for I never was allowed to go
to such a place when I was young," and she
sighed, "but as the Doctor says, there is no
other amusement for the young in this new
country," and she sighed again. "Is Miss
DeWolf going, Louise?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, Ned says he had hard work
to persuade her to go. She don't like to
leave her father. What a pity he is such a
sot. I believe I should detest such a father.
I don't see how she can be so good to him."</p>

<p>"She is a dutiful daughter, Louise, and a
noble girl, and I hope nothing will ever hap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>pen
to prevent her becoming Edward's wife."</p>

<p>"What can prevent it mother? I'm sure
Ned is handsome, and talented and rich
enough for anybody."</p>

<p>"I don't know what could prevent it,
Louise, but I shall be glad when they are really
married. I think a wife of the right stamp
would have a great influence on Edward."</p>

<p>"Why, mother, I'm sure Ned's principles
are good, and he is steady enough for a young
man; I don't see what particular advantage
a wife would be to him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sherman only sighed.</p>

<p>Louise looked a little disconcerted. "Why,
mother," said she, "you act as if you thought
something terrible was going to happen to
Ned and me, and our only escape was matrimony."</p>

<p>"Louise," said Mrs. Sherman after a pause,
"could not Miss DeWolf be prevailed upon
to spend the day of the party with us; she
would only be a few hours longer away from
her father."</p>

<p>"Why yes, I think so," said Louise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
thoughtfully. "Ned could go for her in the
morning. O yes," she concluded decidedly,
"Ned can manage that I know."</p>

<p>Little Wolf spent the day above mentioned
in Mrs. Sherman's family. She was happy;
happier than she had been since her return
home. The memory of the dreadful night
which she passed at Squire Tinknor's had
ever since haunted her. It was only when
in Edward's presence that she forgot it, and
it would even sometimes cloud a moment of
such companionship, as comes only to those
whose very life is bound up in another's.
She often said to herself, it was his first mistake,
it would never be repeated; he would
not dare to indulge again, now that he was
convinced how a stimulant would effect him.
But, spite of all her attempts at self-control,
whenever the well remembered scene came
up before her, she was ready to cry out with
anguish. The society of Edward's mother,
comforted, and reassured her. The son of
such a mother was exalted, if that were possible,
in her opinion, and she instinctively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
gathered renewed confidence in her own future
happiness.</p>

<p>During the day, Mrs. Sherman's penetrating
eye was frequently fixed upon Little
Wolf, as if she would read her very soul, and
the glimpses which she caught, shining out
in her words and actions were on the whole
satisfactory.</p>

<p>Louise, who was naturally rather yielding
and dependent, involuntarily deferred to her
young companion, whose opinions were always
independent and often expressed with
marked decision. In fact, before the day was
ended, Little Wolf's force of character was
felt and silently acknowledged; and little,
and rosy, and curly though she was, she had
become a power in the Sherman family. But
what beauty, what sweetness, what love is
potent when opposed to a depraved appetite?
But why anticipate?</p>

<p>As Edward was busy in his office the greater
part of the day, and the doctor in his professional
duties, they saw but little of the
ladies, and Mrs. Sherman, anticipating their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
wishes, advised Little Wolf and Louise to
dress at an early hour of the evening, in order
to enjoy a quiet social hour all together
before the party.</p>

<p>The mysteries of the toilet occupied more
time than they had calculated upon, and, just
as they were in the midst of an important
discussion, as to whether pink or white flowers
became Louise best, they heard the gentlemen
come in.</p>

<p>"There they come," said Louise, "I hear
them in the parlor; do, mother, tell them we
are most ready!"</p>

<p>"Now Miss DeWolf," said she, turning to
Little Wolf, as her mother left the room,
"how do you think I look?"</p>

<p>"Why you look like a prim puritan. The
roses in your hair look as if they had been
taught to grow very properly all their lives
and they were not going to depart from early
habits, even if they were going to a 'hop.'"</p>

<p>"Now, do you think they look stiff?" said
Louise anxiously.</p>

<p>"Just a little, Miss Louise."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>"Please arrange them for me," said Louise,
stepping up to Little Wolf.</p>

<p>Little Wolf gave the offending flowers
several slight twiches, this way, and that.
"There, how do you think they look now,"
said she.</p>

<p>"O they do look lovely," said Louise, glancing
at herself, admiringly in the mirror,
why could not I fix them so?"</p>

<p>Little Wolf gave her head a slight toss of
triumph, thereby creating a breezy excitement,
quite becoming among her ringlets, and
the moss rose buds with which they were ornamented.
Her dress was white and gauzy,
and her every movement floated it gracefully
about her slender figure.</p>

<p>Louise was also dressed in white, but there
was an air of precision about her, with which
although it accorded well with her conservative
character, she was evidently dissatisfied,
when comparing her appearance with Little
Wolf's.</p>

<p>"I wish my hair would curl like yours,"
she said, glancing from the reflection of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
own smoothly braided locks, to Little Wolf's
dancing ringlets.</p>

<p>"Why I'm sure you look very beautiful indeed,
beautiful as a bride, Miss Louise; now,
go ask the doctor if you don't. Don't wait
for me, the doctor is waiting for you; I'll
come directly when I get this lace fixed."</p>

<p>"Well, remember <i>somebody</i> is waiting for
you," said Louise, as she left the room.</p>

<p>A shower of compliments fell upon Louise
as she presented herself to her brother and
lover. "Now don't waste any more admiration
on me, either of you," said she, "save it
for Miss DeWolf, she is the most beautiful
thing I ever saw. She is grace itself. She
touches a ribbon and it knots itself into an
exquisite shape, she lays her hand upon lace
and it fastens and floats, she gently pats a
flower, and it instantly assumes its most
graceful attitude. O Ned, how happy you
will be."</p>

<p>The words were still upon Louise's lips
when Little Wolf joined the circle, and somehow,
she instantly caught the expression of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
Edward's face, and read in it those emotions,
with which our pen intermedleth not.</p>

<p>It was very pleasant to look into that quiet
parlor, presided over by Mrs. Sherman, who
sat regarding her happy children with so
much tenderness and pride. But we must
not linger, for there are other scenes to be
presented.</p>

<p>It was near the midnight hour when pleasure
ran highest in the brilliantly lighted ballroom
that Edward might be seen leading Little
Wolf to a seat. She had appeared on the
floor many times, and had at length acknowledged
herself weary.</p>

<p>"What a handsome couple," whispered
Louise to the doctor, nodding significantly towards
them, and her whisper was echoed by
many others.</p>

<p>There was a deep red spot in Edward's
cheek, and a flash in his eye, which some
might have attributed to the excitement of
the occasion, but the doctor and those who
knew him well, interpreted it differently.
He had several times during the evening left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
the room with one or two of his friends, who
were in the habit of indulging in a social
glass, and Edward's principles were not such,
as to shield him from their influence.</p>

<p>Little Wolf's quick eye followed him when
he went and when he came; not indeed with
a suspicion of the truth, for it did not occur
to her that he was being led into temptation,
but the fact was about to burst upon her.</p>

<p>"Excuse me for a few moments, love,"
whispered Edward as he seated her, "I will
be back in time to dance the old year out and
the new year in with you; the next is to be
our wedding year, is it not?"</p>

<p>Little Wolf smiled and fluttered her fan to
conceal her confusion.</p>

<p>Two gentlemen were engaged in conversation
near Little Wolf, and, as Edward left
her one of them remarked, "What a pity so
many of our promising young men are falling
into the habit of drinking. There is young
Sherman, if I am not mistaken, under the
influence of stimulant."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>Although not intended for her ear, Little
Wolf caught the words, and her bright smile
faded, and her busy little fan dropped in her
lap. The wound so lately healed was reopened,
and in it had fallen a corrosive poison.
She felt the aching pain, and the eating smart,
she begged Dr. Goodrich to take her from the
room. She had arisen and was leaning on his
arm when Edward returned.</p>

<p>"I see my bird is on the wing," said he
claiming Little Wolf's hand for the forming
cotillion.</p>

<p>Little Wolf caught his breath as he leaned
towards her, and grew paler, "I cannot
dance," said she drawing back.</p>

<p>Edward looked surprised, but the doctor
knew what all meant and he turned with her
towards the door, when who should they see,
but daddy, making his way towards them.</p>

<p>He had evidently come in haste, for his
great rough over-coat was only partly buttoned,
his leggins were put on awry, his over
shoes were untied and the strings dangled
under his feet somewhat retarding his shuf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>fling
locomotion. With fur cap drawn low
so as to protect his face as much as possible
from the biting winds, beard white with
frost, and clusters of snow flakes resting upon
his broad shoulders, Daddy pushed forward
into the throng.</p>

<p>Little Wolf no sooner saw than she ran up
to him, "What's the matter Daddy?" said
she.</p>

<p>"Twixt you and me, Honey," said he
clutching her by the arm, "the doctor is pretty
nigh done fur."</p>

<p>Little Wolf waited for no futher explanation.
She gave her little dimpled arm a jerk
and was out of the room in a twinkling.</p>

<p>"Bless me, twixt you an'me, it will go
hard with the Honey," said Daddy addressing
Dr. Goodrich, "your services is needed.
Miss Hawley said fetch you right along with
the Honey, and, doctor hev' her wrap up right
smart, its awful cold and blowy&mdash;howsoever,
I clapped in two big buffaloes, for I know'd
putty well how gals is dressed at sich places.
Laws, I expect them are buffaloes would keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
her warm if she hadn't  nothing on but that
are outside fish net."</p>

<p>For once Daddy made no useless delays.
He saw that Little Wolf was well wrapped
in as they sped along the frozen river. The
horses were put to their utmost speed, but in
vain. Little Wolf arrived a few minutes too
late to attend her dying father.</p>

<p>With a despairing wail she threw herself
beside his dead body. She did not weep, but
moaned so pitifully that it was distressing to
listen to her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hawley at length went to her and
gently raised her up and removed her hood
and cloak. In her haste, Little Wolf had
made no change in her dress, and she was too
much absorbed in grief to once think of her
appearance. The rose buds fell from her hair
on the still face of the corpse and her white
robes floated over it, while Mrs. Hawley tried
to soothe and speak words of comfort to her.</p>

<p>But suddenly her eye fell upon a form at
the opposite side of the bed. It was Hank
Glutter. She was pale before, but at sight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
of him she became absolutely ghastly. Slowly
she arose to her feet and went around to
where he stood. "Mr. Glutter," said she
solemly, raising her hand, as if to pronounce
upon him some dreadful anathema.</p>

<p>"Miss DeWolf," said Hank, eagerly interrupting her, "do not curse me."</p>

<p>"Vengeance is mine, and I will repay, saith
the Lord," burst from Little Wolfs white lips.</p>

<p>Is there not a curse which the liquor seller cannot escape?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<div class="chaphead"><p><b>Neighborly Sympathy&mdash;Little Wolf's
Bosom Friend&mdash;A Disappointed Lover.</b></p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/capT.jpg" width="100" height="160" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p class="dropcap">he news of the sudden and unexpected
death of Dr. DeWolf, quickly spread
among the few poor families living in
the vicinity, casting a gloom over the little
community, where he had been so long well
known, and, before strong drink got the mastery
of him, greatly respected and beloved.
Many a sorrowful face looked out from doors
and windows towards the old brown house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
on New Year's morning, and one after another,
the sympathising neighbors offered their
assistance at the door of the bereaved, whose
sunny face had often cheered their own quiet
homes.</p>

<p>But poor Little Wolf at the time knew
nothing of their kind intentions. After the
first burst of grief, leaving all arrangements
which the occasion required to Dr. Goodrich,
she shut herself in her own room, and none
dared intrude upon her night of sorrow, except
indeed Daddy, who was indefatigable in
his attentions. The kind hearted old man
wrapped himself in blankets, and lay down
near her door, and, at intervals, during the
hours of that cold January morning, he crept
in softly and replenished the fire, and, after
lingering a moment in the vain hope that she
would notice and speak to him, he would go
away muttering pitifully to himself, "poor
Pet, poor Honey."</p>

<p>About daylight, worn out with anxiety and
fatigue, he fell asleep, and a few hours afterwas
awakened by a hard thump on the head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
and starting up, he saw Sorrel Top, just gathering
herself up from a fall.</p>

<p>Who told you to lie down there like a dog,
for folks to stumble over?" said she angrily,
I thought you were going to take care of Little
Wolf, and here I find you snoring away
and she may be frozen to death, for all you
know."</p>

<p>"Tween you an'me," said Daddy looking
rather mortified, "I'm afeared that are fire
has gin' out."</p>

<p>"Of course it has&mdash;there ain't a good fire
in the hull house. It takes Mrs. Hawley all
the time to tend the door and tell the folks
we don't want their help, and when the funeral
will be;&mdash;I tell ye, we ain't hardly had
a mite of rest since the doctor was brought
home."</p>

<p>"Tell Miss Hawley I'll be down there in
five minutes," said Daddy decidedly.</p>

<p>"It don't make much difference whether
he's here or not," said Mrs. Hawley, when
Sorrel Top had delivered his message.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>"O he'll be handy to talk," replied Sorrel
Top with a grim smile.</p>

<p>"Tween you an' me, it ain't no time fur to
be jokin," said Daddy, who had come in time
to catch a few words, and had a suspicion of
what was passing between the women, "I
guess," he continued "if you could see how
broke down the Honey is, you'd begin to
think it was a serious matter."</p>

<p>"We do already think it a very serious
matter, Daddy," said Mrs. Hawley with great
feeling, and I wish Miss DeWolf would let
me do something for her."</p>

<p>"Taint no use saying a word to her, I don't
open my head when I go into the room, but
I'd lay down my life fur to ease her," said
Daddy the tears coming to his eyes. "Tween
you and me, it ain't no common trouble workin'
on the pet," he said, coming close to the
two and speaking low, "I've knowed her
sence she was a baby, I've seen all of her putty
ways, and none of her bad ways, fur she
never had none; she hes growd up perfect
and she allers treated the doctor dutiful, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
she's got nothin' to reproach herself fur.
I'm afered," and he sank his voice to a whisper,
"the Honey has got a separate trouble."</p>

<p>"What that trouble was Daddy did not define
for he was interrupted by a knock at the
door, which he opened and ushered in the
Sherman family.</p>

<p>"Tween you and me, the Honey ain't spoke
nor slept, nor eat," said Daddy, in answer to
Mrs. Sherman's enquiry after Little Wolf,
"but maybe it will ease her a leetle to know
that you are here," he said, looking sideways
at Edward.</p>

<p>Daddy fidgeted around Little Wolf for several
moments, before he could muster courage
to break the silence, and tell her who
were waiting below, and he almost regretted
having done so, when he saw the look of agony,
which the information brought to her
face.</p>

<p>"Daddy," said she in a choking voice, "ask
Mrs. Sherman to my room, the others will excuse
me to-day."</p>

<p>It was some alleviation to Edward's disap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>pointment,
as he rode home with Louise, to
know that his mother was to be Little Wolf's
companion and consoler until the arrival of
her old friends, the Tinknors, who had been
sent for, to be present at the funeral.</p>

<p>During the few days they were together,
Mrs. Sherman strove by every means she
could devise to give her young friend some
relief from the distress of mind, under which
it was evident she was laboring. But she
was at length obliged to return home, leaving
to Mrs. Tinknor's skill the trying case, which
had baffled her own benevolent efforts.</p>

<p>It was the day on which her father's remains
had been consigned to their last resting
place in a secluded part of his grounds, beside
the grave of her mother, that Little Wolf
sat alone by her upper window looking sadly
out towards the burial spot, which she had
left only a few hours previously.</p>

<p>The Squire and Mrs. Tinknor were in the
parlor below, engaged in conversation concerning
the events of the past few days, and
Tom Tinknor, to whom the solemnities of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
occasion had been extremely irksome, was
wandering aimlessly about the house with
hands in his pockets, occasionally checking
himself in the very act of whistling away the
oppressive silence.</p>

<p>The sudden opening of a door gave him
quite a start, and turning quickly, he saw
Daddy, who said good naturedly, "I guess
ye're skeered ain't ye? 'Tween you an' me
I've felt ruther shaky myself lately in this ere
great big house, where there is so much spare
room, fur ghosts and sperits of pussens is apt
fur to hang around the house where they
die."</p>

<p>"O, that's all nonsense, Daddy," said Tom,
"I thought you knew too much to believe in
such things."</p>

<p>"Wall, I don't really believe in 'em, but I
did feel kinder queer like, last night when I
went through that are long hall to the Honey's
room, but I never hev really seen a sperit
yet, but I've seen shaders that looked
mighty like 'em, and I ain't no doubt, if there
is any, I shell see 'em, fur the Honey says I'm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
uncommon sharp that are way. Laws, she
ain't afeared of nothin: why, she went inter
the doctor's room, the next day after he was
laid out, and stayed thar ever so long all
alone, and wouldn't even come out fur to see
Mr. Sherman, 'Tween you an' me, I guess
the Honey is throwin off on that are Sherman,
fur ye see I hed to go right inter the
ball-room fur her, the night the doctor died,
and I see her, with my own eyes, draw away
from him as if he had hurt her, and I kinder
hed a inklin that may be he'd been drinking
a leetle too much, fur, to my sartin knowledge,
she ain't 'lowed him fur to come nigh
her sence. But I guess its affectin' her serious,
fur she does 'pear to feel the wust she
ever did, and I used to say, sometimes, when
the doctor was brung hum dead drunk, she
couldn't feel no wuss if he was really dead;
but them times was nothin' to the way she
broke down the night he died. 'Tween you
an' me," said Daddy, as if suddenly recollecting
himself, "it wouldn't be best fur to
say nothin' about this to nobody, fur the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
Honey likes to keep her own affairs strict."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said Tom, and he walked
straight to the parlor, and repeated to his
parents every word he had heard.</p>

<p>"She certainly grieves more than is natural
considering the circumstances," said the
Squire, "and if the old man's conjectures are
correct, you are here just in the nick of time,
Tom."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said Tom,
rather dubiously, "she will have to change
wonderfully if she gives a fellow a chance to
see or speak to her while we stay."</p>

<p>"I shall try to prevail upon the poor child
to come down awhile this evening," said Mrs.
Tinknor very gently.</p>

<p>"A handsome fortune is not to be obtained
by marriage every day," said the Squire.</p>

<p>"A noble-hearted, whole-souled woman
like Little Wolf is not to be obtained every
day," said Mrs. Tinknor, "but, I never
thought," said she affectionately regarding
her son, "that Little Wolf cherished other
than a sister's love for Tom."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom was silent, and, after a short pause,
Mrs. Tinknor said, "when you came in Tom,
I was telling your father of a conversation I
had with Little Wolf last evening, concerning
her going home with us, but she thinks
it best, on account of her dependent family,
not to break up house-keeping before Spring."</p>

<p>"Displaying thereby very little financial
ability," said Tom, rather contemptously.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," said the Squire, "Little Wolf
is posted. She knows just as much about
her father's affairs as I do, She would give
me no rest months ago, until I spread out the
whole thing before her, and I believe her to
be as capable of managing the property, as a
woman can be.</p>

<p>"I reminded her of the extra expense attending
house-keeping," said Mrs. Tinknor,
"but she said she felt it her duty to provide
for those poor creatures in her employment.
There's Daddy, you know, cannot, more than
earn his board, and Mrs. Hawley besides being
feeble, has no other home, and nobody
would do as well by an inefficient girl like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Sorrel Top, as she does, and then she has decided
to take Fanny Green into her family
for the winter."</p>

<p>"Now, who is Fanny Green?" broke in
Tom.</p>

<p>"Why, she is the little girl whose father
killed his wife in a fit of intoxication, and
then ran off leaving the child to the charity of
strangers, and I think Little Wolf said, she
was cruelly treated in the family where she is
now living, and the family do not wish to be
burdened with her.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>well</i>" said Tom, drawing a long
breath, "I'm convinced Little Wolf will be a
moping old maid, dressed in black, managing
well her property, devising philanthropic plans
for the benefit of paupers, she is getting too
good for any man that lives."</p>

<p>"The best of it is, she does not even know
she is doing a good thing," said Mrs. Tinknor
smilingly.</p>

<p>Tom got up and walked impatiently to the
window. Having accompanied his parents,
with a view, to himself wipe away the few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
natural tears, that he imagined bedewed the
rosy cheeks of Little Wolf, and pour into her
willing ear a volume of cheering words, as he
should ride by her side on their return trip,
and, finally, to prevail upon her to reward his
unequalled constancy, by becoming his wife,
he was quite unprepared to meet the pale anguished
face beneath the long black veil of
which, for the first time, he caught a glimpse
on the funeral day. Having witnessed the
quiver that shook her delicate frame, as the
grave received its dead, he lost all confidence
in his pre-arranged means of consolation, and
the words of his mother, not having been calculated
to reassure him he was now thoroughly
annoyed at the course things had
taken.</p>

<p>But as Mrs. Tinknor well knew that Tom's
feelings were evanescent, and seldom went
beyond the surface, she immediately arose to
go to Little Wolf, comforting herself with the
reflection, that the storm she was leaving
would be of short duration.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">eantime Little Wolf had not stirred
from her place by the window,
neither had she withdrawn her gaze
from the desolate scene without. All nature
was shrouded in snow. On the ground, on
every tree and shrub, and in the air; snow
was everywhere. But Little Wolf was too
much absorbed in her own reflections to bestow
a thought upon the raging storm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>From the graves of her parents, dimly seen
through the whirling flakes, her mind had
wandered to an equally painful subject, upon
which the timely appearance of her beloved
friend, Mrs. Tinknor, gave her the longed for
opportunity to converse. She had always
confided in that lady, as in a mother, and in
the present instance, nothing was witheld
pertaining to her feelings past and present towards
Edward Sherman, and the relation in
which he stood to her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tinknor's previous interview with
Tom had in a measure prepared her for Little
Wolf's communication, but the tearless eye,
so full of anguish, the white cheek and compressed
lips, all so unlike her brilliant little
friend, struck her painfully; and indignation
towards the author of so much wretchedness
was the uppermost feeling as, in conclusion,
Little Wolf pleadingly asked, "what can I
do, my dear Mrs. Tinknor?"</p>

<p>Now Mrs. Tinknor was a mild, undemonstrative
woman, not prone to giving advice,
but the memory of all the wrongs which she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
had endured through the intemperance of her
husband, wrongs which had sunk deep within
her bleeding heart, nerved her to raise a
warning voice, to save, if possible, one whom
she really loved from a life, to which it made
her shudder to look forward, and she freely
and earnestly answered.</p>

<p>"Think no more of one, who, if you were
to become his wife, would make your life, beyond
all expression, miserable."</p>

<p>Little Wolf laid her hand quickly on that
of her friend and looking straight into her
eyes said vehemently, "I cannot, no, I cannot
do that, could you?"</p>

<p>"Could I, rather, did I," said Mrs. Tinknor,
drawing a long breath, "I had not the decision
that marks your character, darling, and
consequently am a drunkard's wife."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tinknor's voice fell very low, as she
repeated the last words, and Little Wolf involuntarily
clasped more closely the hand on
which she had laid her own.</p>

<p>"You are not, really, what you called yourself,
Mrs. Tinknor," she whispered, "nobody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
calls Squire Tinknor that, oh, do not talk so."</p>

<p>"I do not like to say it my dear, and I
never said it before, but for your sake I lay
open the hidden part of my life, and after you
have heard me through I shall never give another
word of advice as to your future
course."</p>

<p>"I was just of your age, darling, and about
to be married when an intimate friend said to
me," "I'm afraid Mr. Tinknor is fond of
drink, I saw him go into one of those drinking
saloons." I answered carelessly; for I
did not wish her to know that she had made
me anxious; but that evening I repeated her
words to my lover. He made light of it, and
said a friend invited him to drink and he did
not like to refuse; that he might be a man
among men, that there was no danger, he
could stop when he pleased, he only drank
socially, never for the love of it.</p>

<p>"But my fears were aroused and I begged
him with tears, to give up social drinking all
together, and he finally appeared hurt, and
finally asked me if I could not trust him, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>I said yes; for he was so noble, so full of
warm affection, that I was sure I could win
him from those habits, which threatened to
darken our sky. I ventured forth on a dangerous
sea, and clouds and storms have been
my portion.</p>

<p>"Spite of all you love him, and he loves
you," Little Wolf ventured to say, "and
while there is love there is hope, and some
little comfort; life is not entirely aimless and
barren."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tinknor so pitied Little Wolf, who
had so bravely risen above all the misfortunes
to which her young life had been subjected,
only to sacrifice herself to a most unfortunate
attachment, that, for the moment, she was
silent not knowing what to say.</p>

<p>"O do not look so hopeless, dear Mrs.
Tinknor," said Little Wolf eagerly, "tell me
there is something to live for."</p>

<p>"We may, to be good, and do good," said
Mrs. Tinknor slowly, as if to make quite sure
of answering wisely.</p>

<p>Little Wolf caught at the words, "that is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
just what you are doing," she said, "and
why may not I? I know you think I could
not do as you have done; but you do not
know how my heart is in this thing. I did
not know myself until the trial came, why,
Mrs. Tinknor, I could sacrifice my soul for his
sake."</p>

<p>"O darling, darling, I cannot bear to hear
you say so. I cannot bear to have you sacrifice
yourself to one who would not even control
a vitiated appetite for your sake. Believe
me you will regret it, if you become the
wife of an inebriate."</p>

<p>"O he is not that, he is not that."</p>

<p>"He may not have come to that yet,
dear child, but you have seen and heard
enough to convince you that he is on the road
from which few turn back. He has already
felt the debasing effects of intoxicating drink
and still he keeps on, and shall that noble
soul of yours be for a whole life time bound
to one with whom eventually there can be no
sympathy? God forbid. You may remember,
although you were very young, what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
your dear mother's sufferings were; could she
speak to you now, what think you would be
her advice?"</p>

<p>"O my dear, patient, loving, broken hearted
mother," and Little Wolf burst into a
paroxysm of tears.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tinknor leaned very tenderly over her
young friend and kissed her cheek, and, after
this little act of love and sympathy, she went
down stairs, without so much as having hinted
at the object for which she came. However
to the surprise of all, Little Wolf spent
the evening in the parlor with her guests,
and at her earnest solicitation, they consented
to delay their intended departure for a
few days.</p>

<p>It was a sore disappointment to Edward
Sherman to be obliged to meet Little Wolf
day after day under the watchful eye of Tom
Tinknor. But, to Little Wolf it was an infinite
relief, for Mrs. Tinknor's words "think
no more of one who if you were to become
his wife, would make your life beyond all expression,
miserable," rang continually in her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
ears: and, while her heart prompted her to a
different course, her intellect in a measure
approved the advice. Consequently she naturally
shrank from a private interview, before
her mind was fully prepared to meet the
exigency.</p>

<p>The subject was not again broached between
Mrs. Tinknor and herself until the
morning that the first named started for her
home, and it was only at the moment of their
last fond leave taking, that Little Wolf leaned
over the side of the sleigh and whispered
in her ear, "I shall never be able to write to
you about it, but if <i>he</i> refuses to accept the
condition which I feel I <i>ought</i> to make, I will
just send you a lock of my hair and you will
know it is all over with us."</p>

<p>Her lip quivered as she turned away and
as the Squire drove off, Tom who had observed
her agitation said to his mother, "she is
tender hearted, that savage Little Wolf after
all."</p>

Arms&mdash;Fannie Green&mdash;A Catastrophe.</b></p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 110px;">
<img src="images/capA.jpg" width="110" height="160" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><p class="dropcap"> sudden sense of responsibility seemed
to fall upon Daddy, as with Little
Wolf, he watched the Squire's swift
gliding sleigh, and its occupants, until they
had dwindled together, a mere speck on the
silent river.</p>

<p>'Tween you and me, Honey, it won't du
for you to be shiverin, here in the snow. Mr.
Tom said I was fur to take care of you when
he was gone; 'tween you and me Mr. Tom is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
oncommon nice young man, oncommon, considerin
his father, very oncommon."</p>

<p>"How so Daddy?"</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me he's a teetotaler, out
and out, and the Squire ain't. I ketched
him sneakin off down to the brewery several
times. I kinder think Tom takes after his
mother, and its a good sign fur boys to take
after their mother. Now there's Mr. Sherman,
he takes after his father. His every
motion is like the judge. To be sure, the
Judge was a wonderful smart man, but then
when I lived in them parts he was in the
habit of drinkin, pretty heavy. Afore I left
he signed the pledge, but there ain't no tellin
how he would have turned out if he had
lived."</p>

<p>It was plainly to be seen in whose interest
Daddy was enlisted. His diplomatic efforts
were listened to with great composure and he
could only speculate on the result as he went
into the house with Little Wolf.</p>

<p>The parlor was in a state of confusion, Mrs.
Hawley and Sorrel Tom having combined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
forces to raise the greatest possible amount
of dust and disorder out of the material at
hand; such as the ashes from the Squire's
segar inadvertantly dropped, the dirt from
Tom's boots which he never remembered to
clean, and Daddy's careless litter in making
the fire. The light litter was easily disposed
of, but the inevitable stain left by the melted
snow upon the carpet occasioned an angry
outburst from Sorrel Top, who did not see
her young mistress just behind.</p>

<p>"Tom Tinknor is a filthy fellow," said she,
and I'm glad he's gone; he kept me cleaning
up after him all the time, and now here's two
more great spots to be scrubbed."</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me Tom didn't make
them are," said Daddy indignantly.</p>

<p>"He did, too."</p>

<p>"He didn't nuther, I see Mr. Sherman set
in that are very spot yesterday."</p>

<p>At the commencement of the dispute, Little
Wolf slipped away and sought refuge in
her own room, and Daddy embraced the opportunity
to lecture Sorrel Top soundly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, you've disgusted the
Honey," said he, "speakin so unrespectful
of her friends."</p>

<p>"She don't know nothing about it," said
Sorrel Top.</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me she stood right behind
you and heered the hull," said Daddy
triumphantly.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," said Sorrel Top, getting
very red in the face.</p>

<p>"I'll leave it to Miss Hawley," said Daddy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hawley corrobarated the statement
and Daddy continued his lecture.</p>

<p>"'Tain't never best to speak disrespectful
of nobody," said he, "I never du, except of
them are liquor sellers, and sich low critters.
'Tween you an' me, Mr. Tinknor is a very
respectable young man; he told me he'd
never drunk a drop of liquor in his hull life,
except once when he had the colic, and it
ain't likely he'll ever tech the infarnel stuff
agin, for he ain't subject to colic, and if he
should be tackled with it, I've told him how
to doctor with hot plates and yarb tea. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
advised him not to send fur no doctor, fur
ten chances tu one, they would prescribe
brandy. Them doctors, as a general thing,
don't know no better than to prescribe things
fur young men that gits 'em in the habit of
drinkin. I wouldn't hev the Honey heard
you run down Mr. Tom, as you did, fur no
money. I hope this will be a warnin fur you
to be oncommon keerful of that are tongue
of yourn in futur."</p>

<p>"I guess Miss DeWolf can tend to her
own affairs without anybody's help," said
Sorrel Top, not in the least dismayed by
Daddy's expostulations. "I wonder what
has sot you agin Mr. Sherman, he is much
more agreeable than Tom Tinknor, and I had
rather clean up his dirt a thousand times,
than so much as set a chair for that silly
Tom."</p>

<p>"You never had no penetration, no how,"
said Daddy contemptously, "if you ever
marry you'll get a drunken loafer to wait on,
no doubt."</p>

<p>With this unkind prophesy on his lips,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Daddy got himself out of the sound of Sorrel
Top's retort as quickly as possible, and, as he
could whenever it suited him, make an errand
to Little Wolf's room, he very soon made it
convenient to start with an armful of wood
in that direction.</p>

<p>The fire was burning very briskly and Little
Wolf sat before it in an attitude of deep
thought, so Daddy very gently put down the
wood, and was going out, when his young
mistress called after him.</p>

<p>"Daddy."</p>

<p>"Yes, Honey."</p>

<p>"Daddy, I've been thinking of going for
Fanny Green to-day."</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, its a oncommon fair
day, likely you wouldn't take no cold.</p>

<p>"Well, daddy, we will drive over for her,
early this afternoon."</p>

<p>The honor of riding with Little Wolf and
the errand on which, they were going combined
to form an occasion of deep interest with
Daddy who hastened down, eager to impart
the information he had obtained. But, as on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>ly
Sorrel Top was visible, and she in a fit of
sulks, in the bringing on of which he had
been instrumental, he delayed his important
communication for a more appreciative audience,
and contented himself with the performance
of what he considered a solemn
duty.</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, its never best to
pout," said he, "I've seen many a handsome
face spiled by it."</p>

<p>Having administered this inflammatory admonition,
Daddy betook himself to the wood
pile, where he pecked away with uncommon
assiduity until he was called to dinner.</p>

<p>Putting away his ax with alacrity, he hurried
into the house, with an air of a man of
business, and soon, under the influence of a
very palatable dinner, his tongue loosed more
agreeably.</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, the Honey and me
have been talkin the matter over," said he,
"and we are going fur to fetch Fanny this
afternoon."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>"You ain't told us no news," said Sorrel
Top, "has he Miss Hawley?"</p>

<p>"I didn't go fur to tell no news, a man
never expects to tell <i>women</i> any news."</p>

<p>Daddy told this little fib good naturedly,
although it was evident that he was the least
bit annoyed.</p>

<p>Sorrel Top delighted in view of Daddy's
discomfiture, and her temper restored, condescended
to disclose the part she was to act
in the matter.</p>

<p>"I've just been fixing a bed for her in the
little room inside of Miss DeWolf's," said she
"and as it ain't at all likely she'll be very
tidy, brought up as she has been in that old
shanty, I expect to have to teach her to keep
it in order."</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, it's time I was gittin
ready fur to fetch her," said Daddy glad of
an excuse to terminate the interview.</p>

<p>Little Wolf was on the veranda when
Daddy drove up, for she was aware that her
spirited little saddle horse, Fleet Foot, was
as a general thing rather restive in harness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
However, on the present occasion, his behavior
was unexceptionable, and, in a few minutes,
he was trotting off, the perfection of
docility.</p>

<p>It was about a half an hour's drive to Mr.
Wycoff's the farmer in whose family Fanny
Green was living, and it was not to be expected
that Daddy could by any means remain
silent for that length of time, and as the subject
most likely to interest his young mistress,
he fixed upon Fleet Foot.</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, Fleet Foot is oncommon
stiddy to-day."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Little Wolf, absently.</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me hosses is like pussens,
they ken be coaxed better than driv,
fur generally speakin, coaxing brings 'em
round when driving won't. It always makes
my blood brile tu see a hoss abused, and the
men that du it ain't much better than them
are liquor sellers, and I have always said that
they were the meanest of God's creation.
'Tween you and me, if common folks had had
the care of Fleet Foot, you couldn't do noth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>in
with him. He's naturally as full of fire as
an egg is of meat, and he's a very knowin
hoss tu; the minute you're in the saddle he
pricks up his ears, and dances off like a young
colt, fur he knows you like fur to have him
prance and show off; but when I back him,
he knows just as well he's got a stiddy old
man aboard. When I fust took him out this
afternoon, he went a caperin and carcerin
round, and one spell I cum mighty nigh not
gitting harness on him, but laws if anybody
ken manage a hoss I ken," and Daddy unconsciously
gave the reins a triumphant jerk,
which instantly increased Fleet Foot's speed
to what the careful old man considered an
alarming degree, and by the time they had
reached their destination, he was nearly out
of breath, and had become quite nervous in
his efforts to check the spirited animal.</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, it wont du to keep
Fleet Foot standing long in the cold," suggested
Daddy anxiously as Little Wolf was
alighting.</p>

<p>Sharing Daddy's anxiety Little Wolf stated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
to Mrs. Wycoff as concisely as possible, the
object of her visit, and that individual brought
the affair to a crisis in the following summary
manner.</p>

<p>"Here's the girl, take her. Fanny put on
your hood, and that old cloak that was your
mother's. Mr. Wycoff has given you to this
lady, and she's in a hurry. Now be quick."</p>

<p>Fanny's little white tear stained face fairly
shone with delight, as she followed her new
found friend to the sleigh. No alteration had
been made in the mantle which was once her
mother's, and Daddy wrapped her carefully
in its ample folds and stowed her away at
his feet, and she looked her last upon a house
where she had suffered, as ill treated, motherless
children sometimes do suffer.</p>

<p>From the day of her mother's death, she
had excited Daddy's earnest sympathy. He
had seen her carried home by Mr. Wycoff,
whom he knew to be a hard man, and fond
of strong drink. Mrs. Wycoff had the reputation
of being no better than her husband,
and Fanny's fate was generally commiserated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
when it was known that she was to be nurse
and chore girl in that family. She had been
there but a few months, however, when the
infant under her charge suddenly sickened
and died, and as she was too small and delicate
to be put to hard labor, the family had
no futher use for her. These facts coming
to Little Wolf's knowledge through Daddy,
she had successfully employed him to gain
Mr. Wycoff's consent to give the child up to
her."</p>

<p>There was a world of gratitude in Fanny's
sweet blue eyes, when occasionally she would
modestly turn them up to Little Wolf as
they rode in silence.</p>

<p>Daddy was to much absorbed in holding
the reins to think of anything else, and as
they neared the last long hill he drew a sigh
of relief, "'tween you an' me, we're all right
so fur," he said.</p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth
before they were half way up the hill. Just
on the brow they saw a two horse team,
which as the road was narrow and the sides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
precipitous and rocky could only be passed
with safety where it then was. Imagine
then the dismay of the little party as they
saw the heavy sled descending, and the
driver madly urging on his horses.</p>

<p>Daddy shouted at the top of his voice, Little
Wolf sprang upon her feet and waved
her handkerchief with all her might, and little
Fanny said dispairingly, "Oh its Mr.
Wycoff, he is drunk, oh he <i>will</i> run over us."</p>

<p>Down, down, with fearful rapidity came
the heavy team, the driver flourishing his
whip and shouting dreadful oaths; while like
lightning leaped Fleet Foot onward to his
destiny. An instant more and Little Wolf
had thrown Fanny from the sleigh and leaped
after her down the side hill. There was
a crash, a prolonged neigh; Fleet Foot's
death yell, as, for an instant, he hung suspended
from the sleigh, which had caught on
a projecting rock, and all was silent save the
distant clatter of horses' hoofs and the faint
hallos of the drunken maniac.</p>

<p>At the moment of the collision, Daddy had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
risen to his feet and was in some unaccountable
way thrown uninjured into the road.
Although stunned and bewildered by the fall,
his faculties gradually brightened and he was
soon in a condition to survey the scene.</p>

<p>On a ledge of rocks overhanging the precipice
was the forlorn wreck of the once fanciful
little sleigh. In the depths below lay
Fleet Foot, stretched motionless upon the
rocky bottom. The deep ravine into which
he had been plunged ran angling, and formed
the point, where by her presense of mind
Little Wolf had saved herself, and Fanny
from almost certain death.</p>

<p>At this point the hill was less steep, and
the snow had fallen to a great depth, forming
a bed as soft as down, and cushioning the
very rocks. Upon this capacious couch of
unsullied whiteness, lay Little Wolf and
Fanny.</p>

<p>Powerless himself to render any assistance,
Daddy opened his mouth and there went
forth a wail such as caused Little Wolf to
start and shudder as she thought of what it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
might portend. But her worst fears were in
a moment dispelled, as she saw Daddy's anxious
face bending imploringly over the bank.</p>

<p>"Honey" said he most dolefully.</p>

<p>"Yes, Daddy."</p>

<p>"'Tween you an' me, you ain't hurt nun,
be you?"</p>

<p>"Not very much, Daddy, but when I try
to rise I only sink deeper in the snow.
Hark! I hear the sound of bells."</p>

<p>"Well, now, if there ain't Mr. Sherman
coming down the hill," said Daddy delightfully.
"'Tween you and me, Honey, that
are Mr. Sherman will hev fur to help you git
out. His legs is a heap longer than these
old stumps of mine."</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">he circumstances which had brought
Edward Sherman so opportunely to the
scene of disaster were simply these:</p>

<p>On his way to call upon Little Wolf he had
ridden round to Hank Glutter's saloon in order
to leave a package of Eastern papers, as
an act of courtesy in return for previous favors
from Hank. As he pulled up before the
door, Mr. Wycoff, urged by the proprietor,
came reeling out with blood-shot eyes, and
swearing that he would never leave the place
without another drink. Hank had some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
trouble in coaxing him on to his sled, and
getting him started for home. Having rid
himself of his troublesome customer, he turned
his attention to Edward.</p>

<p>"Come in, Mr. Sherman," said he, "I am
at liberty now. That man Wycoff has been
quite an annoyance to me of late. He has
no control over his appetite, and consequently
ought never to drink; but I can't refuse
him, and it wouldn't mend the matter if I
did, for he can easily get it elsewhere, and,
perhaps, where no discrimination would be
used, and he would become too much intoxicated
to get home at all; but drunken loafers
are not allowed to hang around here."</p>

<p>"I have brought some papers which I
thought you might like to look at," said Edward
taking no notice of what the other had
said.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Sherman, you had better
come in a while. I have just received
some sherry said to be very fine. I would
like your judgment upon the quality of the
article."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>"Another time, Mr. Glutter; I am in something
of a hurry to-day."</p>

<p>"Well, just wait a minute," said Hank,
and he darted in and brought out a bottle
and slipped it in the corner of the sleigh under
the buffalo. "There," said he, "try it at
your leisure, Mr. Sherman."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Glutter,&mdash;good day,"
and Edward hastened to the home of Little
Wolf.</p>

<p>When informed by Sorrel Top that Little
Wolf had gone to Mr. Wycoff's for Fanny,
his pride was at the moment piqued; for he
well knew that she had reason to suppose
that he would visit her that afternoon. Since
the memorable New Year's eve, when leaning
upon Dr. Goodrich's arm, she had so resolutely
turned away from him, he felt that
all was not right between them; and he had
looked forward with longing impatience for
the hour, when, once more alone with her, he
could ask an explanation. Although he was
confident that she was then absent purposely
to avoid him, alarm for her safety over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>came
every other feeling, and with a foreboding
heart, he turned in the direction she had
taken.</p>

<p>From the top of the hill he saw enough to
hasten him down to Daddy, and from thence
through snow and rocks to Little Wolf.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt, darling?" he said, eagerly
grasping her hand.</p>

<p>Little Wolf uttered an exclamation of pain
and fainted. Edward turned pale. "Daddy,"
he shouted, throw down that bottle in the
corner of the sleigh."</p>

<p>"What is it you want fur to give her," said
Daddy, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"It's wine; throw it down here quickly."</p>

<p>"She won't tech the infarnel stuff."</p>

<p>"She has fainted, you simpleton; give me
the wine."</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, there ain't no bottle
here," said Daddy, doggedly. "Sprinkle a
little snow in her face, and she'll come too."</p>

<p>"Daddy," thundered Edward, completely
exasperated, "throw down that wine, or I'll
know the reason why."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>"The reason why, is," said Daddy, deliberately,
"there ain't no bottle in this ere
sleigh&mdash;'tween you and me, this ere hoss of
yourn is gettin mighty oneasy, I'm obleeged
fur tu stand at his head every minute."</p>

<p>"Hitch him somewhere, Daddy, and throw
the buffalo over him&mdash;the bottle is under
the buffalo, you'll find it and bring it."</p>

<p>"No I won't bring it nuther," muttered
Daddy to himself."</p>

<p>"I guess there's something the matter with
Miss DeWolf's arm, she couldn't use it when
she tried to get up," said a voice close behind
Edward.</p>

<p>He turned and saw that the suggestion had
come from Fanny Green, who lay a short distance
off, cosily wrapped in the form of a little
black bundle.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt, Fanny?" he said.</p>

<p>"O no, I'm not hurt a bit," she answered
brightly. "I prayed that I might be saved,
and I was saved."</p>

<p>"I wish you would pray we might get safe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>ly
up this steep place into the road," said Edward.</p>

<p>"Miss DeWolf is very little, replied Fanny
hopefully, "I guess you can carry her up.
If my cloak was off, I think I could walk by
myself."</p>

<p>Edward undid her cloak and stood her upon
her feet. He then raised Little Wolf in
his arms, and staggered a few feet in the
snow, and laid her down again, almost discouraged.
But as he could devise no other
plan to rescue her from her unpleasant situation,
he redoubled his efforts. He occasionally
stumbled against rocks, and fell into
drifts, but always so as to shield his burden
from harm.</p>

<p>Daddy was stubborn in witholding the bottle,
and Little Wolf at length awoke to consciousness
without it. Awoke to feel herself
pressed close to Edward's throbbing breast,
to listen to endearing words, that warmed into
new life and vigor the hope in which she
had indulged. The hope, that possibly,
through her influence, he might be persuaded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
to give up the only habit which marred his
otherwise unblemished, character.</p>

<p>"Darling, darling, you are safe now with
me," he whispered, as she unclosed her eyes;
"were you hurt by the fall?"</p>

<p>"Only my arm, Edward; it is very painful.
I'm afraid it is broken&mdash;oh, put me down,
the pain makes me faint."</p>

<p>"I love so to hold you to my heart," he
said as he let her slip softly on the snow, and
examined the wounded member.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> really broken, just above the wrist,"
he said in surprise, how careless I have
been!"</p>

<p>Edward was not skilful in surgery, but he
did the best he could with pocket handkerchief
bandages.</p>

<p>Little Wolf nerved herself to bear the pain
which every movement aggravated, and Edward
again lifted her up.</p>

<p>"Now, darling, we shall soon get to the
top."</p>

<p>"Where is Fanny?" said Little Wolf, suddenly
remembering her protege.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, she is somewhere, working her way
along in my track," said Edward.</p>

<p>Both looked back, and not far behind saw
Fanny kneeling with closed eyes beside a
snow capped rock. Her tiny hand, rough
and red with cold and toil, clasped devoutly
upon her breast, and her lips moved as if in
prayer. The little black quilted hood she
wore had fallen back, revealing soft golden
hair, radiant in the slant rays of the declining
sun, and upon her cheek a tear glistened like
a dew-drop on a flower.</p>

<p>"The tears came to Little Wolf's eyes.
"Poor little thing! she feels forsaken," she
whispered, "let us wait and encourage her."</p>

<p>While they were waiting a neighboring
farmer happened along; a strong, stalwart
man, who joined right heartily in helping
them out of their difficulty.</p>

<p>The first thing that Edward did when he
reached the sleigh was to search for the bottle
of sherry. "Strange," said he to Little
Wolf, "Mr. Glutter certainly put a bottle of
sherry here as I came along, and now it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
nowhere to be found. I wish I had it for
your sake."</p>

<p>Daddy glanced furtively at Little Wolf,
who, suspecting the truth, murmured something
about feeling better.</p>

<p>"He ain't a goin fur to git none of that infarnel
stuff down the honey," said Daddy to
himself, as the sleigh with Edward, Little
Wolf, and Fanny disappeared down the other
side of the hill.</p>

<p>A consultation was next held between
Daddy and the farmer as to the probable condition
of Fleet Foot, which was speedily ascertained
by the latter who chanced to have
a rope with him suitable for letting himself
down to where he could test the case. Scaleing
the rocks with his temporary ladder, he returned
the verdict "died of a broken neck."</p>

<p>"I was pretty nigh sartin he was stun
dead," said Daddy, gravely. "I'm much,
obleeged to ye, neighbor; I guess I'll go hum,
bein I can't du nothin fur the poor critter.&mdash;I
tell ye, neighbor, these are things takes
right hold on me. Fleet Foot was a buster,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
and I sot heaps by him, and so did the honey.
'Tween you and me, that cussed, infarnel
liquor drinkin is at the bottom of a awful
heap of trouble. If I could make the laws,
the hull infarnel stuff would be handled like
pison and pistols, ruther keerful."</p>

<p>"Wycoff is pretty well off, I guess he can
be made to pay pretty heavy damages," said
the farmer.</p>

<p>"'Tween you an' me, that ere is poor consolation.
Supposen the honey's neck had
been broken, and the chances was agin her,
what money du ye think could pay for her
life? I tell ye what, the thing is all wrong,
liquor makin and liquor sellin does mischief
that no money can't pay fur."</p>

Wolf lay upon her bed feverish with
pain. Her arm was in bandages, and
Dr. Goodrich stood by soothing and encouraging
her. Louise Sherman having arrived,
kindly relieved Mrs. Hawley, who embraced
the opportunity to slip out and regale herself
with a cup of tea.</p>

<p>As she approached the kitchen, the sound
of Daddy's voice reached her ear, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
few words that she caught hastened her footsteps
thither.</p>

<p>"It was as much as ever I could du fur to
hold Fleet Foot," he was saying as she opened
the door.</p>

<p>"Go on, Daddy," said Mrs. Hawley as he
paused at her entrance, "I want to hear all
about it."</p>

<p>"Wall, as I was a tellin Sorrel Top," he
continued, "I was pretty nigh done out a

him there want nun there."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss DeWolf would give you fits if she
knew what you'd done," said Sorrel Top,
"the wine want yourn."</p>

<p>"Wall, it was the devil's, and I slung it tu
him," retorted Daddy triumphantly, "that

fur I want a goin fur to hev him pour pisen

speaker darting a contemptous glance at
Sorrel Top.</p>

<p>"Well, Daddy, what happened next?" said Mrs. Hawley, soothingly.</p>

<p>"I ain't a goin fur to tell nothin more tonight,"
said Daddy decidedly. "If folks
can't listen without interruptin me, they may
wait till they ken," and he shot another
meaning glance at the offending Sorrel Top.</p>

<p>"I guess," said Sorrel Top with some asperity
"you're not the only one that can tell
me about it, is he Fanny?" she said turning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
to Fanny Green, whom she discovered to
have fallen fast asleep in her chair.</p>

<p>"'Tween you an me," said Daddy rather
dryly, "I guess you won't hear no more of
that are story to-night."</p>

<p>Sorrel Top's temper was slightly ruffled
and she began to shake Fanny rather roughly.
"Wake up, Fanny," said she "wake
up."</p>

<p>"Oh! Mrs. Wycoff, don't whip me,"
mourned Fanny piteously, as she opened her
eyes, "I didn't mean to go to sleep, but I
was so tired."</p>

<p>"Don't you know no better than to treat
a little motherless thing in that are way?"
said Daddy coming indignantly forward.
"Come here, Fanny," and he took the child
tenderly in his arms; "if anybody speaks a
cross word to you in this are house, they'll
git reported."</p>

<p>By degrees Fanny awoke, and was borne
off to bed by Mrs. Hawley.</p>

<p>Scarcely had they gone when a new object
of interest attracted Daddy's attention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
There was a slight rustling at the outside
door, and in stalked a sturdy Indian in blanket
and leggins and soft moccasins, causing
his firm tread to fall noiselessly, and giving
Daddy a superstitious start, as if he had
seen an apparition. The red man stated in
broken English that he had brought a letter
a long way from the "lodge of the pale face,
to the Wolf squaw."</p>

<p>Daddy hastened to put the letter in Little
Wolf's hand. It proved to be a rather
lengthy communication from Antoinette La
Claire, and as all were interested, at Little
Wolf's request, Louise proceeded to read it
aloud.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="author">
"Fairy Knoll, Jan. 20th, 18&mdash;.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Miss DeWolf</span>:</p>

<p>A faithful Indian, known for a long time
to cousin John, has called here on his route
to Chimney Rock and I embrace the opportunity
to write to you, as it will probably be
the last I shall have before spring opens.</p>

<p>Cousin John has fitted up a cosy little
room for me in the loft. It is hung around
with skins and blankets, and is made com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>fortably
warm by the fire below. There is
one little window from which I obtain a fine
view of the "City of Trees," which you used
so much to admire. They are now shorn of
their foliage, and snow and ice cover the
branches, and, forsaken by their summer inhabitants,
they stand and sadly moan day
and night.</p>

<p>But these mournful sounds pass unheeded,
by the happy couple in this peaceful cottage.
Not a cloud has yet darkened their "honeymoon."
All their hours are pleasant hours,
and all their dreams are pleasant dreams.
On these wintry mornings we rise rather late;
after the sun has peeped in at the window a
long time.</p>

<p>Cousin John goes out in the warmest part
of the day to split rails, but, even then, he
finds it convenient to take his brandy bottle
with him. He is a firm believer in the efficacy
of brandy to keep out the cold. But
when, with the experience I have had, I see
him in perfect strength and health, go out
day after day with that little flask in his side
pocket, I pray that it may never become a
snare to him.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, as he was about starting,
I ventured to remonstrate with him.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>"Cousin John" I said, "I would not take
the brandy to-day, I do not think you will
miss it." He laughed good naturedly, and
turning to Cousin Maria, he said, 'Maria
dear, Antoinette is concerned about my morals.
Shall I tell her of a certain lady who
drained Mr. Sherman's wine bottle on her
way to Fairy Knoll?"</p>

<p>Cousin Maria blushed and said, "I am sorry
John that I ever touched it. Let us now
mutually pledge ourselves never again to
drink anything that will intoxicate." But
Cousin John only laughed, and kissed his
young wife tenderly and went away to the
wood, taking the brandy bottle with him.</p>

<p>When he came home at night, and the supper
was over, and he had, as usual, seated
himself by Maria and taken her hand in his,
(at which signal I invariably become suddenly
sleepy and am obliged to retire,) I stole
away from the scene, and sitting down by
my little window, looked out into the faint
moonlight, and thought much and long upon
the joys and sorrows of earth, but most upon
its sorrows, for the "whole creation groaneth,"
and my own heart is always sorrowful.</p>

<p>I do not know why, but it may have been,
and probably was, because all the anguish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>and sorrow that has ever come under my personal
observation, has been occasioned by
that drink that "biteth like a serpent, and
stingeth like an adder," that the scene of the
morning mingled with the thought of my
cousins below eagerly quaffing their cup of
bliss; the sweetest that earth offers to youthful
lips. 'Can bitter drops ever mingle
there?' thought I. 'Can the honey become
wormword and gall, and every joy be forgotten?
Can the little speck that I thought I
saw this morning on the horizon become a
great cloud and overshadow us all?' In imagination
I saw lovely cousin Maria pale and
faded, and careworn, and cousin John's noble
and manly countenance bloated and brutish,
as I have seen men become by the use of
stimulating drinks, and involuntarily I threw
up my hands and cried, 'Is there none to
help?'</p>

<p>It may have been a morbid condition of the
mind that wrought these sad fancies, and I
am sure those who have never realized the
danger of the cup would treat them lightly,
but you dear friend, know that from just such
beginnings the most harrowing sorrows have
sprung.</p>

<p>I know cousin John would smile if he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>knew what a serious matter I have made of a
thing that he considers so trifling, and he is
so good and kind to me, and his whole soul
so free from vice, that I almost regret having
put these thoughts on paper. But out of the
fulness of my anxious heart I have written
as perhaps I ought not.</p>

<p>God grant that all my fears may prove
groundless, and that the serpent's sting may
never, never more through another's infatuation
reach our hearts, or yours.</p>

<p>I was at length aroused from my reverie by
our Indian visitor. I caught a glimpse of him
just as he emerged from the woods, and before
I could go down to announce his coming,
he was within, and by his noiseless footfall
had taken my cousins greatly by surprise.
Maria was smoothing her rumpled hair and
looking rather annoyed at the unceremonious
intrusion, while cousin John and his visitor
were deep in the mysteries of "jargon,"
which being interpreted by my humble self
was truly startling and shocking.</p>

<p>He stated that two "pale faces," were lying
a short distance off, frozen to death. His
supposition was that they had indulged too
freely in "fire water."</p>

<p>Cousin John immediately accompanied him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>to the spot, and found indeed two men cold
and stiff in death, and the empty bottle found
upon their persons gave evidence of the
cause. The Indian recognized one, having
seen him with my dead brother, and said he
was "no good pale face," and his name was
Prime Hawley. They found in the pocket
of the other an old letter addressed to "Hiram
Green, Chimney Rock." You may possibly
know something about the latter.</p></div>

<p>"Fanny Green's father, and Mrs. Hawley's
husband," ejaculated Little Wolf. "Hark,
Louise," she added in a whisper, "they have
heard it all."</p>

<p>Sounds of distress were heard in the adjoining
room where Mrs. Hawley was engaged
in putting her little charge to rest. Both
she and Fanny had heard every word of the
letter and the news of the unhappy death of
the husband of the one, and the father of the
other, burst suddenly upon them, and deep
and tearless groans of Mrs. Hawley and Fanny's
heart breaking sobs mingled together.</p>

<p>"Put the letter away Louise, <i>do</i>," said Little
Wolf, turning her face away with a heart
truly sick.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<div class="chaphead"><p><b>A Crisis&mdash;pride and Folly.</b></p></div>


<p>For weeks Antoinette's letter lay in the
drawer where Louise had hastily thrust it,
and no one had read it to the end.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hawley's health, which had been feeble
for a long time, rapidly declined after the
news of her husband's death, and in a few
days she took to her bed, and shortly after
died. The sickness and death of a member
of her family, combined with her own sufferings
so absorbed the mind of Little Wolf,
that at the time she thought of but little else.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
But when it was all over, and her arm had
partially healed, she began to realize acutely
the anomalous position in which the purpose
she had formed placed her to Edward.</p>

<p>It is true he came every day, and always
with words upon his lips that sent the hot
blood to her cheek, and each time she strove
in vain for courage to approach the subject
upon which hung her destiny. It was no
wonder that she thus halted; that her heart
stood still at the bare possibility of losing its
idol; for, orphaned and alone, beyond it she
saw no light in her path; only fearful darkness
like the shadows of death.</p>

<p>There had been no word of explanation,
and Edward seemed to have forgotten that
he had ever desired any, and he had settled
into his former assurance. His mother had,
of late, spoken to her confidentially of the
time when, as Edward's wife it would be her
pleasure to relieve her of all troublesome
cares; and Little Wolf listened in silence and
in agony. She longed to unbosom her feelings
but restrained herself with the resolve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
that she would, without delay, make them
known to Edward.</p>

<p>In this state of mind she one day opened
the drawer where lay Antoinette's letter and
taking it out sat down to read it. She found
nothing of interest in the contents, except
that which she had previously heard, until
her eye caught the postscript at the bottom
which read thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"One day later. The Indian stayed yesterday
to assist in burying the dead. He has
just breakfasted and will start in a few moments,
and I hasten to tell you the good
news. Rejoice with me, all my fears are put
to flight. Last night my conscience told me
that I ought to invite cousin John to read
this letter. He looked so serious when he
had done so, that I was afraid I had offended
him. But this morning to my utter astonishment
he handed me a Total Abstinence
Pledge, drawn up in due form, with his own
name and Maria's signed to it, and playfully
bade me write my name with theirs. "For,"
said he, "Antoinette, I intend in future to
look well to the morals of my household, and
see that they touch not, taste not, handle not,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>any beverage that will intoxicate." I burst
into tears, and he said, "O well, if you feel
so badly about it, you need not sign it," but
he well knew they were tears of joy, and
there would be no trouble about signing
it. Would that the head of every family in
the land, might do as cousin John has done.
Then indeed, there would be rejoicing around
many a fireside, where now sits sorrow and
despair.</p>

<p class="regards">In love and haste,</p>

<p class="author">"<span class="smcap">Antoinette</span>,"</p></div>

<p>Little Wolf sat pondering over what she
had read, never dreaming that her lover was
peeping in upon her through the half open
door. But Edward was to full of what he
had come that day especially to say, to delay
long, and he tapped lightly to attract her
attention. Little Wolf welcomed him to her
side, with the determination that she would
then and there speak frankly upon the subject,
which had so long pressed upon her
mind.</p>

<p>But Edward had scarcely seated himself
before he began in high spirits to speak of
family arrangements.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>"Louise and the doctor," said he, "have
finally fixed upon their wedding, and darling,"
he said, lowering his voice, and speaking
earnestly, "it remains for you to say
whether or not, ours shall be at the same
time.</p>

<p>Little Wolf's pulse quickened almost to
suffocation, but she controlled herself bravely,
and placing her finger on the last passage
in Antoinette's letter, she said, "read that,
Edward."</p>

<p>Edward did as she desired, and again turned
upon her a questioning look.</p>

<p>"Now, Edward," said Little Wolf, smiling
although her lip slightly quivered, "I am
ready to set up house-keeping with you any
time, provided you will put your name with
mine to a pledge like that of which you have
just read."</p>

<p>Although she had spoken playfully, Edward
saw she was deeply in earnest, and his
pride kindled, as the truth flashed upon him.</p>

<p>"Darling," said he, reproachfully, "I may
have given you reason once, in an unguarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
moment, to fear for me, but I had hoped that
that scene had long since been forgotten."</p>

<p>"It will never more be remembered, nothing
of the kind will <i>ever</i> be remembered,"
Little Wolf hastened to say, "If I but have
your promise."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Edward clasping her in
his arms, "I promise."</p>

<p>In due time Little Wolf disengaged herself
and opening her writing desk, she drew him
towards it, saying, "Now, Edward, you draw
up the document, and we will both sign it.</p>

<p>"What document do you wish me to draw
up? Is not my pledged word to love, cherish
and protect you not enough, you little infidel?"
said Edward gayly."</p>

<p>"It is my request that you draw up a
pledge promising to abstain from all intoxicating
drinks, and sign your name to it, and I
will put mine to the same," said Little Wolf,
in the same gay humor.</p>

<p>"Why, darling," said Edward, in surprise,
"my promise was all you asked."</p>

<p>"O yes, your promise to sign a total absti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>nence
pledge was all I did ask," said Little
Wolf cheerily, "and now, all I ask is that
you do as you agreed."</p>

<p>"I did not understand it so," said Edward,
"but never mind, darling; now listen to me.
Would you, provided it were in your power,
prevent my taking a harmless glass of beer in
a warm summer day?"</p>

<p>"Well, Edward, of course I would not
wish to prevent your indulging in any <i>harmless</i>
enjoyment, but don't people sometimes
get intoxicated on beer?"</p>

<p>"Only slightly elevated," said Edward
laughingly.</p>

<p>"O, Edward!" broke forth Little Wolf in
agony, "I wish you could see this thing as
I do but you cannot."</p>

<p>There was silence for a few moments,
which Edward broke by saying, sympathizingly,
"I know why you feel as you do, darling,
and I do not wonder at it, but warned
by my own, as well as the experience of
others, I shall keep a strict watch over my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>self
for your dear sake, and I assure you
there is no danger of me."</p>

<p>"Then," said Little Wolf, despairingly, "I
cannot persuade you to pledge yourself to total
abstinence?"</p>

<p>"No," said Edward decidedly, his pride
deeply wounded by her implied doubts of his
inability to control his appetite, "if you feel
that you cannot trust yourself with me after
all I have said, I can say no more."</p>

<p>Had Edward fallen dead at her feet, Little
Wolf could not have looked at him more
hopelessly. But Edward was blind to her
mute anguish, and mortified and impatient at
her silence, and little dreaming of what her
answer would be, he at length asked rather
coolly, "Do you really feel that you cannot
trust your happiness with me?"</p>

<p>Little Wolf struggled a moment for composure,
and then bowed her head in the affirmative.</p>

<p>Edward's flushed face suddenly paled.
"Very well," said he proudly, and without
another word abruptly withdrew. His quick,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
impetuous footsteps echoed through the hall;
the front door opened and closed, and soon
the distant tinkling of bells announced that
he had really gone.</p>

<p>As the lovely violet closes its leaves when
the shadows of night gather round, so closed
the flower, which, in the sunshine of love,
had bloomed in the heart of Little Wolf. She
neither wept nor made any other demonstration
of sorrow, but as she sat silent and alone
her lips grew firm, and her eyes brightened
and the pupils expanded, and her whole being
seemed rising up in supernatural strength
to bear the blow.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">n his way home, Edward Sherman
found himself suddenly assailed by a
chorus of eager voices, as he unexpectedly
encountered a sleighing party of gay
young friends. They were bound for a settlement
near by, where rural festivities were
in anticipation.</p>

<p>As he reluctantly drew up alongside of the
capacious establishment, where nearly a dozen
ladies, (including his own sister), and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
about the same number of gentlemen were
cozily stowed away, he was beset with urgent
solicitations to join their company.</p>

<p>The affair, they stated, had been gotten up
on a short notice during his brief absence
from the city, and his sister had been inveigled
into it, with the expectation of meeting
her brother, and particular friend Dr.
Goodrich. But the doctor had given them
the slip, and they could not, on any account
dispense with his society. Louise joined her
entreaties with the others. "I will ride with
you, brother," she said, if you will only go."</p>

<p>"No, no;" objected the gentleman who
sat next her, "I will propose a more fitting
expedient. Let Mr. Sherman close his eyes
and throw a soft snow ball into the crowd,
and upon whomsoever the ball shall rest, let
her be transferred to his sleigh."</p>

<p>The proposition at first occasioned quite a
tumult, but finally all laughingly agreed to
it. Into their midst quickly flew the lump
of glittering snow and rested upon the belle
of the party, Miss Clara Hastings, and Ed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>ward
in triumph bore off the crested prize.</p>

<p>Miss Hastings, we have said, was the belle
of the party, nor was this all; she was one of
the most popular young ladies in the city of
Pendleton. Her father, Judge Hastings, a
man of talent, and high standing, had bestowed
every advantage upon his only child,
and she, petted and caressed in society as well
as in the family circle, handsome and dashing
in appearance, with spirits unbroken, gave
life and interest to every amusement in which
she was engaged. The turn the affair had
taken was therefore as much regretted by her
friends, as it was gratifying to Edward, to
have obtained so agreeable a companion.</p>

<p>The lady herself did not appear in the least
disturbed by the change. On the contrary,
as they started off in advance of the rest, her
smiling face indicated the satisfaction which
she felt at the result; for from the first of her
acquaintance with Edward, she had conceived
a decided partiality for him.</p>

<p>"It will be nice to get there and rest and
warm before the others arrive," she said, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
they rapidly outdistanced the other sleigh.</p>

<p>"Yes, and have a little time all to ourselves,"
Edward replied, in pretty much the
same style in which he would have addressed
Little Wolf, had she been by his side.</p>

<p>Miss Hastings looked surprised and tossed
her head proudly, freeing the plumes in her
jaunty little cap of their snowy remains, and,
as the soft particles showered upon Edward,
and pelting his cheek, he turned and looking
her full in the face said, "those little ice
bolts, Miss Hastings, serve to remind me
of what a lucky individual I have been this
afternoon."</p>

<p>"Have you always been lucky, Mr. Sherman?"
said Miss Hastings waiving the intended
compliment.</p>

<p>A look of pain crossed Edward's face, but
he answered quickly, almost defiantly, "Not
always," and giving his horse a smart cut, he
created such a jingling among the bells, that
farther conversation was rendered impracticable,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>"The destination was soon reached, and,
being joined by the remainder of the party,
the evening hours charged with pleasure flew
rapidly, to most of the assembled guests.
But neither Edward, nor Miss Hastings
were in their happiest mood, and the latter
complaining of a headache Edward signified
his willingness to conduct her home before
the party broke up.</p>

<p>Again in the open air, her indisposition
was relieved, and she chatted cheerily, and
made herself so agreeable, that her companion
really became quite interested, and, loth
to part with her, as they drove up before her
father's house, he proposed to prolong their
ride.</p>

<p>"It is early yet," he said, "and your head
is so much better in the open air, would you
not like to drive out of the city again for half
an hour?"</p>

<p>"O no, I thank you, Mr. Sherman," she
said with a gratified smile," "the family are
up waiting for me, and I would be happy to
have you go in and see papa. He will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
treat you to a glass of superior domestic
wine."</p>

<p>Edward went in and drank the wine, and
spent a pleasant half hour. Shortly after
leaving he fell in with some friends, who invited
him into another place where choice
wines were kept, and he drank again and yet
again, and finally went home quite exhilerated
under the influence of stimulant. He found
that his sister had arrived some time previously,
and she and his mother, and the doctor
were quietly seated around the center-table,
and had been wondering at his non-arrival.</p>

<p>"Give an account of yourself, loiterer,"
said Louise, playfully, as he joined the circle.</p>

<p>"We had a fine time Lou, did we not?"
said he patting her cheek.</p>

<p>"O, if by <i>we</i> you mean yourself and Miss
Hastings I suppose you did have a good time,
but I did not enjoy myself a bit."</p>

<p>"Not a bit, are you quite sure? I thought
I saw you smile very benignly on a certain
young getleman, who objected to your riding
with me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>"An optical dulusion, brother, entirely so,
I would have much preferred to have gone
with you."</p>

<p>"Now I'll kiss you for that," said Edward,
suiting the action to the word.</p>

<p>"O Ned, what have you been drinking?
Your breath smells of <i>something</i>."</p>

<p>"O, I went in and took a glass of domestic
wine with Judge Hastings," said Edward
carelessly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sherman instantly took the alarm.
"I am afraid," she said, that these domestic
wines create an appetite for more hurtful
drinks. Don't you think so, Edward?"</p>

<p>"Why no, mother. If every family kept
a supply of pure domestic wine in the cellar,
and were at liberty to drink when they pleased,
there would, in my opinion, be much less
drunkenness than there is at present. Plenty
of pure wine would soon do away with the
adulterated liquors so common in public
places and social drinking would become
much more harmless than it is at present. I
would advise you, mother, to keep up a vig<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>orous
correspondence with Recta on the subject,
about currant time next summer, for it
is getting quite fashionable to manufacture
your own wines."</p>

<p>"Mark my words, Edward, the fashion
will prove an injury to society; frequent indulgences
in any drink that will intoxicate,
it is well known, has always proved more or
less fatal to the peace and prosperity of communities,
as well as individuals. I can well
remember the time when social drinking was
practised in almost every family, and at all
fashionable entertainments, and I well remember
the consequences. The ruin it
wrought cannot be told. It was wine in the
cellar, and on the side board, Edward, as
well as stronger drinks that did the mischief.
Good men and brave, felt its effects and gave
the alarm, and great efforts were made to
put a stop to the evil, and thousands were
reclaimed from drunkenness, but, of late
years, the agitation has in a measure subsided,
and the evil is again on the increase, insinuating
itself into families in the form of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
domestic wines, which are generally supposed
to be so harmless, but which are, in reality,
the foundation of intemperance."</p>

<p>"You cannot make people believe that
mother."</p>

<p>"The time will come when they will be
forced to believe it, my son; for the free use
of domestic wines in families, is not going to
keep husbands, brothers and friends from the
lager beer saloons where the feet of the unwary
become so easily entangled. On the
contrary, past experience proves that the
taste for stimulating drinks acquired at home
rather has a tendency to lead men to frequent
such places."</p>

<p>"But, mother, remember it is not the use
of these things, but the abuse, that does the
harm."</p>

<p>"True, my son, but the use in nine cases
out of ten, leads to the abuse, and it is strange
that mothers and sisters will imperil their
happiness for fashion's sake. I would rather
that Judge Hastings had offered you an adder
in the cup, than the drink which he did;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
for had you seen the poisonous reptile, you
would have turned from it, but, hidden in
the enticing wine, the serpent's sting fastens
itself upon the vitals and its victim knows it
not."</p>

<p>O, mother, you are perfectly beside yourself
on the subject. Judge Hastings is a man
who, I make no doubt, has drank moderately
all his life; and who among us is more
vigorous in mind and body? It is all nonsense,
the idea that a man must necessarily
become a drunkard, because he occasionally
indulges in stimulants."</p>

<p>"Ma, ma," broke in Louise, who saw that
her mother felt hurt, "you might as well
hand Edward over to the persuasion of Miss
DeWolf. If anybody can convert him she
can. The doctor says she becomes more
beautiful and interesting every day. What
do you think, Ned? The doctor was there
this afternoon while we were out sleigh riding;
he confesses it himself.</p>

<p>"I must bid you good night," said Edward
abruptly, and, quite to the surprise of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
trio he withdrew without another word.</p>

<p>His mother suspecting something wrong,
followed him to his room, and with true
motherly solicitude sought out the cause.
"Edward," said she, "when you were a boy,
you used to confide all your annoyances to
your mother. Can it be that anything has
been said this evening to wound your feelings?"</p>

<p>"There are none that love like a mother,"
said Edward, putting his arm tenderly around
her neck, "and there is none in whom I can
so safely confide as in you, mother, but manhood's
griefs are not so easily soothed as boyhood's.
It is not now a broken kite to mend,
or a bruised finger to bind up, would it were;
would that I had not lived to see this day."</p>

<p>"Why, Edward, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean, mother, that Miss DeWolf has
refused to become my wife, and all because I
would not consent to pledge myself to total
abstinence from all liquors. I would not deceive
her and bind myself to pursue a different
course from that which I intend. My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
habits, I believe, are generally considered
good, and if a woman cannot take me as I
am, I would not ask her to take me at all."</p>

<p>"O Edward, Edward," said Mrs. Sherman
beseechingly, "do not let wounded pride,
and self-will, come between you and the woman
you really love, for I do assure you,
young ladies like Miss DeWolf are very rare."</p>

<p>"Were she a thousand times more lovely
and interesting, beloved more she could not
be, but, mother, I shall never yield the point,
and admit that I am incapable of controlling
my appetite. When it suits me to take a social
glass with a friend, I shall do it; and
when I choose to decline it shall be of my own
free will."</p>

<p>"You are a free agent, certainly, Edward,
you may pursue the course you have marked
out for yourself, and go through life a moderate
drinker, and young men may point to you
as you have to Judge Hastings, and make
your escape an excuse for venturing in the
same dangerous path, and thus go down to a
drunkard's grave; or you may yourself ven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>ture
to near the precipice, and before you are
aware take the fatal plunge; for drunkenness,
like death, generally takes the victim
unawares. In either case your influence
must inevitably act upon those with whom
you associate, and you cannot escape the
fearful responsibility. Then judgment day
alone will open the records of those who
have been forever ruined through the influence
of moderate drinkers, as well as the confirmed
drunkard. The preponderating influence,
however, lies with the moderate
drinker; with such men as Judge Hastings;
who, perhaps, have given the subject but little
thought, and who having through a long
course of years tampered without apparent
injury, with the intoxicating cup, deem that
others may do as he has done.</p>

<p>"Yes, and so they may, mother, if they
choose. Every man must answer for his own
crimes and not for the crimes of others."</p>

<p>"True Edward, and if your neighbor become
a drunkard, see to it that the sin lies
not at your door."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>Edward made a gesture of impatience.
"Mother" he said bitterly, "I am not in a
mood to hear much more to-night. I am sorry
that we do not think alike, but, as we
never shall, perhaps the less said about it the
better."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sherman silently kissed her son, and,
with a foreboding heart, withdrew to her own
room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<div class="chaphead"><p><b>Letter Writing&mdash;Daddy's Nocturnal
Labors and Early Walk.</b></p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/capT.jpg" width="100" height="160" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p class="dropcap">here were two letters written by
lamp light in the old brown house, the
day Edward left so unceremoniously.
One was by Little Wolf to her confidential
friend, Mrs. Tinknor. A few hasty hopeless
lines traced upon the dainty sheet; a long
glossy curl folded within and her task was
done.</p>

<p>The other, Daddy addressed to the sweet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>heart
of his youth, Miss Orrecta Lippincott.
He had for some time meditated opening
a correspondence with the object of his early
affections on the subject of matrimony, but
the magnitude of the undertaking had hitherto
deterred him; and, at last, he was only
brought to the point by the encouragement
of his young mistress.</p>

<p>He had resorted to his regularly organized
plan of loitering in her room under pretext
of mending the fire, while he marked with
admiration the easy movements of her pen.</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, Honey," said he,
when she had finished, "I wish I could write
like that. I've been wanting fur to write a
letter fur sometime.</p>

<p>Little Wolf, without the remotest idea of
what the subject of the letter in contemplation
was to be, said kindly, "Well, Daddy,
you may sit right down here if you like, and
use my pen and ink."</p>

<p>Daddy shuffled along hesitatingly towards
the vacant seat. "Tween you and me I'm
afeared I shall make a very sorry job on it,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
said he, "I ain't writ none to speak on this
forty year."</p>

<p>"Shall I write it for you Daddy?"</p>

<p>"O no, Honey. I'll try myself, fust anyhow."</p>

<p>"O well, I'll go down to the parlor and
you shall have the room all to yourself."</p>

<p>"I couldn't stand it no-how fur ter hev
the Honey laugh at the old man's foolishness,"
muttered Daddy to himself, as Little Wolf
slipped away, glad to be relieved of all responsibility
in the matter, and feeling less
perhaps like laughing at the old man's eccentricities
than ever before in her life; and, indeed,
it was a long time afterwards before she
felt like laughing at all.</p>

<p>In the hall leading to the parlor, she met
Sorrel Top, who blushingly begged a private
interview, which Little Wolf was too obliging
to deny, although she panted to indulge
her thoughts alone.</p>

<p>The interview, however, did not detain her
long. Sorrel Top had under consideration
an offer of marriage and wished to ask advice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
which Little Wolf gave without a smile, or
change of countenance.</p>

<p>"Well, Sorrel Top, if he is as you say a
man of good habits, and loves you and you
love him, I see no objection to your getting
married as soon as you like."</p>

<p>While Sorrel Top's affair was being thus
satisfactorily disposed of, Daddy was anxiously
bending over the sheet, upon which he
could not get courage to make the first mark.
There he sat silent and anxious, looking vacantly
first at the ceiling, then at the pen
which stood exactly perpendicular between
his clumsy fingers. At length in dispair he
arose and began to walk the floor, and then
for the first time he observed Fanny Green
quietly playing with her pet kitten.</p>

<p>"Fanny," said he, "do you know how to
write?"</p>

<p>"O yes, Daddy, a little; mamma taught
me to make all the letters."</p>

<p>"Well, Fanny," said he coaxingly, "come
here and make a D for me; won't you?
"'Tween you and me I've forgot which side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
the plaguey quirl goes. Here take this ere
piece of paper, you might spile the sheet, and
I'm mighty particular about hevin it in prime
order."</p>

<p>As she took the pen Fanny suddenly began
to distrust her memory. "Maybe I've
forgot myself, Daddy;" rolling up her blue
eyes to the anxious face bending over her.
But she succeeded admirably in performing
her task, which Daddy duly approved, by
declaring that the quirl was almost equal to
the Honey's quirls. His effort to copy it
was also a success.</p>

<p>"See here, Fanny," said he pausing again,
"you spell dear, d-e-r-e, don't you?"</p>

<p>"O no, Daddy, I spell it d-e-e-r. It's spelled
so right under the picture of one in my
book."</p>

<p>"'Tween you an' me, I don't mean that
ere kind of a dear, Fanny, I guess it's d-e-r-e,
I mean. Howsoever, I'll spell it so and risk
it. Now, Fanny," said he, again dipping his
pen in the ink, "you stand right here, fur
there may be more letters that I've forgot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
how tu make, and if you'll show me, and
help me fur to spell a letter, I'll mend your
sled for you to-morrow."</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, the child, with visions
of coasting in her pretty little head, combined
wisdom with Daddy's, who also had his
visions, while he wrote as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dere Orrecta.</span></p>

<p>"Mi hart has allers ben yourn, it is old
now, but it ain't dride up nun. will yu
marry me now iv got tu be a poor old man.
if yu wil i wil cum fur yu on the fust bote.

<p class="regards">your old flame,</p>
<p class="author">philip Roarer</p>

<p>Chimney Rock. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Minnesota territory."</p></div>

<p>"'Tween you an' me I reckon that ere is
tu the pint, anyhow," said Daddy, proudly
folding the letter, upon which he had spent
two hours of hard mental labor. "I wonder
what keeps the honey away so long; it must
be monstrous cold in the parlor. Tom Tink<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>nor
wont thank me fur lettin the Honey git
cold; bless her heart. That ere sled will git
fixed to-morrow, you may depend on't, Fanny,
fur I shall feel fust rate;" and Daddy
capered out of the room as jolly as a half
grown boy, with a plum pudding in anticipation.
But, we will do him the justice to say,
that there was a depth and earnestness of
feeling in this life-long devotion, to which the
ebullitions of youth can bear no comparison.</p>

<p>How to break the matter to Little Wolf
was Daddy's next anxiety. He stood in mortal
dread of the ridicule of his young mistress,
but still felt that he ought to confide
in her. After taking several fidgety turns
before the parlor door, he finally resolved to
make the <i>denouement</i>, and boldly face the
consequences.</p>

<p>But the condition in which he found Little
Wolf changed the course which he had
marked out. She had lain down upon the
sofa where fearfully pale and cold and still,
she rested, utterly prostrated by the events
of the day. Daddy had never seen such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
ghastly look upon her face before, and the
vague fear that life had fled horrified him,
as he stood gazing at her in mute astonishment.</p>

<p>At a movement of the slight little figure
Daddy was reassured, and he bent over her
in tender solicitude, "O Honey, O Pet, be
you sick? you look awful pale?"</p>

<p>A groan escaped Little Wolf, and, with a
long drawn sigh, she rose up languidly. "I
don't feel quite well to-night, Daddy," she
said.</p>

<p>"O, Honey, you ought fur to have somebody
to nuss you; old Daddy don't know
nothin about gals, and Sorrel Top don't
know nothin about nussin neither. Now
here's the letter I've jest writ, if you feel able
fur to read it, Honey, you will see that I am
tryin fur to git somebody here fur to take
care of you suitable."</p>

<p>Daddy watched closely the effect upon
Little Wolf, while she purused the letter, and
as he discovered no symptoms of ridicule, he
fairly worshipped her for her forbearance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
"Honey," said he, "what du you think on
it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Little Wolf absently,
"I think on the whole it will do very
well."</p>

<p>Daddy's face fairly shone. "I know'd you
would agree tu it," said he, "you allers had
uncommon penetration."</p>

<p>Little Wolf sat shivering and silent, while
Daddy pronounced his eulogy, and the old
man began again to be alarmed. "O Honey,"
he broke forth, "what makes you so
sick? the doctor said you was doin fust rate
this afternoon. I guess I'd better go fur to
fetch him right off."</p>

<p>"O no, Daddy, I'm only chilled; you may
light me to my room."</p>

<p>"Sartin I will, Honey, and I'll keep a fire
fur you all night, fur I shouldn't sleep a wink
nohow."</p>

<p>True to his word, Daddy diligently tended
the fire, creating in Little Wolf's apartment
a general disturbance by his nocturnal labors.
Had she been so inclined, sleep would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
been impossible, while Daddy's enthusiasm
raged, for a series of disasters attended his
most careful efforts. The bedroom door
creaked, the stove door grated on its hinges,
the shovel and tongs would rattle, and there
was sure to be an occasional downfall of
wood, which echoed through the lonely house
like the voice of seven thunders.</p>

<p>It was therefore quite a relief to Little
Wolf when the grey morning hours began to
dawn and Daddy consented to seek a little
repose, with the promise that he should not
be allowed to over-sleep, "fur," said he, "I
must start airly fur to post them are letters,
and you won't mind a calling of me, Honey,
bein you had such a oncommon night's rest,
fur I took particular pains not to disturb
you."</p>

<p>Little Wolf did not think it worth while to
mention that she had lain awake the entire
night, for there was then no counting upon
the effect such a communication might have
upon Daddy's already over-wrought sensibilities.
As it was, he left her, flattering him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>self
that he had greatly contributed to her
health and comfort, and, with an approving
conscience, laid him down and slept.</p>

<p>At the appointed time he was awakened
by Fanny, and rubbing open his eyes, he asked,
"Is the Honey up yet?"</p>

<p>"O yes, Daddy and we've all had breakfast,
and I've got my sled all ready for you
to mend," said Fanny cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Why yes, Fanny, I know I promised fur
tu mend it; but, 'tween you and me, I've got
fur to go to Pendleton first." Howsoever,
I'll fix it afore night."</p>

<p>Fanny looked rather grave.</p>

<p>"'Tween you an' me, I'm sorry fur tu disappoint
you, Fanny, but the Honey would
be wuss disappointed if I did not post her
letter."</p>

<p>"Yours too, Daddy, you musn't forget it,"
said Fanny thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Fanny's exhortation Daddy
actually forgot both letters, having neglected
to take them from his pocket when he
changed his coat, Imagine then his conster<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>nation,
when, having arrived at the post-office
and rummaged his pockets in vain he
discovered his mistake.</p>

<p>At this critical juncture young Sherman
and Dr. Goodrich, arm in arm, happened to
drop in at the office, and Daddy, for reasons
of his own, pounced upon the latter and held
him fast. "Doctor," said he, "'tween you
an' me, was you a going fur tu see the Honey
to-day? She was took very poorly last
night. I was afeared she was clean gone one
spell."</p>

<p>"Did Miss DeWolf send for me, Daddy?"
said the doctor uneasily regarding the grip
that the old man had fastened upon his coat
sleeve.</p>

<p>"Why no, doctor; she sent me fur to mail
some important letters, and I actually left
'em at home in my tother coat. One of
'em was fur to go tu Miss Tinknor; 'tween
you an me the Honey is mighty fond of Miss
Tinknor. I'm kinder calculatin the old lady
will be the Honey's mother-in-law some
day."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>The start which Edward gave at this announcement
was perceptible to both Daddy
and the doctor. The former, not relishing
such a demonstration of interest from so questionable
a source, inwardly resolved to put
to flight the false hopes by which he imagined
the young man was agitated. Casting a
side long glance at his intended victim he added,
"Mr. Tom is a very uncommon fine
young man; he is stidy; he never drinks
nothin. The Honey has know'd him allers;
they played together when they was children
and has allers been uncommon attached.
Tom particularly requested me fur tu take
good care of her while he was gone, and I
ain't no doubt if the good Lord was fur tu
take her away it would nigh about break his
heart."</p>

<p>The doctor, conscious that Edward did
not relish the subject, and anxious himself to
terminate the interview, waved the matter,
simply saying, "I shall be going that way
by-and-by, Daddy, and will call upon Miss
DeWolf if I have time."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
On this assurance Daddy's grasp readily
relaxed, and his prisoner, taking advantage
of this favorable symptom, made his escape.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">he day was mild and spring-like, and
Daddy had not been long gone, when
the snow began to yield to the soft
touches of the sun's bright rays.</p>

<p>Fanny stood by the window and sighed,
and wished audibly that the sun would "put
on a veil."</p>

<p>The wish and manner so entirely foreign to
the child's naturally cheerful and contented
disposition attracted Little Wolf's attention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why Fanny, do you complain of this
lovely day?" she said, in surprise.</p>

<p>"O no, Miss DeWolf, but I was afraid the
snow would all melt away before my sled
was mended, and I love so much to be out of
doors coasting."</p>

<p>"How would you like to take a walk with
me?" said Little Wolf, willing to amuse the
child, for whom she had already conceived a
warm affection.</p>

<p>"O I would like it ever so much," said
Fanny, joyfully.</p>

<p>"Now where shall we go, Fanny?" said
Little Wolf, as they started out.</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know," said Fanny hesitatingly;
"when mamma used to take me
out, she said we must go somewhere where
we could do good. Sometimes we went over
to old Mrs. Peters'; she is sick all the time,
and has no one to help her except her grandson,
Charley. Mamma used to make her bed,
and read the bible and pray with her, and
comfort her all she could. Poor mamma often
wished she could carry her something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
nice to eat, but we hadn't hardly anything to
eat ourselves. May be you wouldn't like to
go there, though?" said Fanny, doubtfully.</p>

<p>Little Wolf hesitated.</p>

<p>"She used to know your mamma," said
Fanny, "and she said that Mrs. DeWolf was
one of the kindest friends she ever had."</p>

<p>"We will go there, Fanny," said Little
Wolf decidedly</p>

<p>Their way lay over the very hill where occurred
their disastrous collision with Mr.
Wycoff; about half a mile from the foot of
which, on a cross road, lived Mrs. Peters.
Fanny ran joyously on before, occasionally
turning back to call Little Wolf's attention
to a squirrel, or a bird, never dreaming that
her companion was less interested than herself.
In this way they reached the top of the
hill, and began the descent, when suddenly
Fanny began to look grave and loiter beside
Little Wolf. At length she spoke in a subdued
whisper, "There lies poor Fleet Foot,
Miss DeWolf; he will never breathe again."</p>

<p>Little Wolf sank upon a rock by the way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>side,
and hid her face in her hands. She
thought and said aloud, "O, why was I spared
to be so wretched?"</p>

<p>Fanny burst into a flood of tears. "What
would have become of me if you had been
killed?" she sobbed.</p>

<p>Surprised at this demonstration of affection,
Little Wolf looked up and drew Fanny towards
her. The child's words, she knew not
why, had consoled and strengthened her.
"Fanny," said she, "everybody must have
something to live for, and I have you"</p>

<p>"O yes, mamma used to say we must all
live to do good," said Fanny, brightening.</p>

<p>Little Wolf rose and struggled bravely to
choke down her rising feelings, for just then
she was comparing the bright voyage of life,
which she had so lately pictured for herself,
with the dark and stormy reality. At that
moment, when she would have scorned to
indulge in pusillanimous grief, her noble spirit
recognized and bowed in willing obedience to
the sublime principle involved in Fanny's
life-inspiring words.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Fanny," she replied, "if I do live,
I hope it will not be in vain. I'm afraid I've
been very wicked and selfish all my life."</p>

<p>"O, Miss DeWolf I'm sure you are the
<i>bestest</i>, <i>preciousest</i> woman next to my mother,
that I ever saw in all my life."</p>

<p>Fanny made this declaration with the air
and assurance of one whose years had embraced
a century; but at that moment, an
object met her eye, which reminded her that
she was but a helpless child. "O, there is
Mr. Wycoff!" she exclaimed suddenly, as
the rough farmer was seen coming up the
hill.</p>

<p>Fanny trembled violently, for she feared
this man. But Little Wolf, constitutionally
brave, in her present state of mind feared
nothing, composedly seated herself again upon
the rock.</p>

<p>The farmer advanced slowly, and recognized
Little Wolf with a bow, and reassured
Fanny with a cordial "How are you, Fanny?"
Then, as he observed traces of tears
on Fanny's cheek, and Little Wolf's sad look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
and mourning dress, he stopped short. "Now
Miss DeWolf," said he, bluntly, "I may as
well say it first as last, I did not mean to run
over you that day, but I had been drinking,
and did not know what I was about. Whatever
you say is right, I will pay you, for I
have felt mean about it ever since; 'specially
as you haven't made any fuss about it."</p>

<p>Little Wolf appeared noble indeed, as she
feelingly replied, "Mr. Wycoff, I would
cheerfully make the same sacrifice again, if
by that means I could persuade you never to
taste another drop of intoxicating drink."</p>

<p>"O, I cannot agree to that," said Wycoff,
"but I shall do the fair thing by you, for you
have acted like a lady."</p>

<p>Then Little Wolf, with a sudden impulse,
arose and stepped forward, and began to plead
earnestly and eloquently with the man to
give up the use of the intoxicating cup. Nor
did she plead in vain. The strong man at
length yielded to her persuasions; persuasions
around which hung the fragrance of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
bruised heart, from which they emanated;
touching, irresistible.</p>

<p>Inspirational hours are often the fruit of
anguish unutterable. The suffering soul begins
unconsciously to feel upward, and, at
the propitious moment, heaven appoints its
work. Thus Little Wolf received her mission,
which, with characteristic energy she
delayed not to fulfil.</p>

<p>His word having been pledged to total abstinence,
Wycoff turned back towards home.</p>

<p>"I was only going to the brewery to meet
a few friends," he said, "and if I don't drink
with them I may as well keep away."</p>

<p>He walked along with Little Wolf and
Fanny as far as the cross road, and when
they parted, again renewed his vow right
heartily. "Never fear, Miss DeWolf," he
said, "I shall never taste another drop of
liquor, so help me Almighty God."</p>

<p>"There, now we are <i>certain</i>, ain't we, Miss
DeWolf? for he asked God to help him. O,
I'm so glad, I'm so glad you have lived to do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
good," said Fanny, as the farmer passed on.</p>

<p>Fanny was exuberant. Her little heart
overflowed, and, at intervals during the remainder
of their walk, "I'm so glad, I'm so
glad," rang out on the still air in sweet,
childish accents, mingling with the songs of
spring birds, and echoing through the lonely
woods.</p>

<p>Arrived at the cottage, they met a warm
welcome from Mrs. Peters. For many
years, widowed and bed ridden, she had lingered
in pain and poverty. Her grandson
Charley, a bright, active youth, orphaned at
an early age, had, since the death of his
mother, been her constant companion and
faithful nurse.</p>

<p>He was her pride and her delight, and she
in turn shared his warmest affections. It
was beautiful indeed to see the noble-hearted
boy yielding all his young strength in providing
for her wants. His small earnings at
wood cutting, combined with the charity of a
few kind hearted neighbors, had during the
winter, kept them from absolute want. No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
wonder, then, that the ambitious youth, anxious
to escape the pinches of poverty, was
eager to accept a situation in Hank Glutter's
saloon, that morning liberally offered by the
proprietor in person. No wonder that, grieved
and disheartened by the opposition of his
grandmother, he met Little Wolf and Fanny,
(who had interrupted their discussion of the
matter), with a downcast countenance.</p>

<p>Conscious that his manner had been observed,
the old lady hastened to apologize,
"My Charley is feeling quite badly just now,"
she said. "Mr. Glutter called here this
morning on the way to one of our neighbors,
and offered him a clerkship. He will call
soon for his answer, and I was just telling
Charley that I was unwilling to have him go
where he would be exposed to so many temptations."</p>

<p>"Grandmother needs the money," said
Charley, "and it is for her sake I want to
go. She needn't be afraid of my getting bad
habits."</p>

<p>"Well, Charley, we will talk about it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
again bye and bye," said the old lady, soothingly.</p>

<p>"But there's Mr. Glutter, now, grandma,"
said the boy springing to the door, "do let
me tell him that I will go, <i>do</i> grandma," he
begged with painful earnestness.</p>

<p>"Do as your grandma think's best, and
you will not be sorry," said Little Wolf in
an undertone as Hank approached the door.</p>

<p>"Well, my man," said Hank with great
assurance.</p>

<p>"I must do as grandma says," and Charley
threw the door wide open.</p>

<p>At sight of Mrs. Peters' visitors, Hank
gave a start of surprise, but quickly recovering
himself, he bestowed upon each a gentlemanly
greeting, and without futher ceremony,
plunged into the business upon which he had
come.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Peters, have you decided to
accept my offer?"</p>

<p>"You are very kind and generous, Mr.
Glutter, and I thank you," said the old lady,
anxious to soften her refusal; but too honest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
to give any except the true reason, she continued,
"the truth is, I do not like to have
Charley go where the influence will be so unfavorable
to his becoming a good, sober man."</p>

<p>Had she studied to make it so, Mrs. Peters'
guileless reply could not have been more
inflammatory to Hank's temper, for, like
others of his class, he was peculiarly sensitive
to any reflection cast upon his business. His
eyes flashed, and his lip curled scornfully,
but having in mind Little Wolf's presence,
he responded smoothly enough, "Very well,
Mrs. Peters. Good morning; good morning,
ladies," and bowed himself out of the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peters drew a sigh of relief, but poor
Charley, after struggling a moment for composure,
left the apartment with quivering lip,
and Little Wolf soon caught a view of him
through the window, wiping his eyes with his
coat sleeve.</p>

<p>"Poor dear Charley," said his grandmother,
"it comes hard on him now, but, God
willing, I hope he will live to thank me for it."</p>

<p>Little Wolf rose hastily. "I must go out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
and have a little talk with Charley," she
said.</p>

<p>"She is just like her father," said Mrs.
Peters, as Little Wolf flitted from the room,
"when he first came to Chimney Rock he was
a princely looking man.</p>

<p>"O, she is the beautifulest lady I ever
saw," was Fanny's enthusiastic rejoinder.</p>

<p>"I have understood that she is very gay
and fashionable since she came from boarding
school."</p>

<p>Fanny was at first rather doubtful as to
what construction to put upon the reports
which had reached the ears of the old lady,
and she hesitated to endorse anything of the
nature of which she was not quite clear; but
she finally compromised the matter by saying,
"if it is very good to be gay and fashionable,
then she is, for she is nothing else but good."</p>

<p>"Well, if she is only a humble, devoted
Christian like her mother, I shall be satisfied,"
sighed Mrs. Peters.</p>

<p>Fanny had by this time come to the conclusion
that gay and fashionable was only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
another name for superior goodness, and she
answered accordingly. "Why, Mrs. Peters,
she is really a very gay, humble, fashionable,
devoted Christion. She is gooder than her
mother, for she never took me away from bad
people as she did."</p>

<p>Not deeming it worth while to enter into
any troublesome explanations, Mrs. Peters
determined to suit her language to the child's
comprehension, said simply, "Well, I hope
she loves God, and will teach you to love him
too."</p>

<p>"O, she does love God, Mrs. Peters. I
heard her speak to him ever so many times
last night, and I was teached to love him
before she had me," said Fanny very seriously.</p>

<p>At this instant the object of their conversation
made her appearance followed by
Charley, whose countenance exhibited quite
a different aspect from that which it had
worn a short time previously.</p>

<p>Little Wolf had successfully held the cup
of consolation to him in the form of a pres<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>ent
and a promise, and she was now about to
take her leave, but Mrs. Peters detained her.
Never came one into her presence that she
allowed to depart without first satisfying herself
as to whether, as she expressed it, they
had "got religion."</p>

<p>Now, it was her belief that pure and undefiled
religion before God is this: "To visit
the widow and fatherless in their affliction,
and to keep ourselves unspotted from the
world." An intimate acquaintance with the
book in which these sentiments are to be
found, had quickened her perceptions as to
their true meaning, and, as by that standard
she gave judgment, it was not easy to deceive
her.</p>

<p>Highly as Little Wolf had risen in her esteem,
and highly as Fanny had eulogized the
piety of her young benefactress, there yet remained
a doubt in the old lady's mind as to
the entire soundness of her religious principles.
A straightforward question while she
still held Little Wolf's hand in her parting
grasp, "Dear child, I know you visit the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
widow and fatherless in their affliction, but
do you keep yourself unspotted from the
world?"</p>

<p>The innocent rejoinder, "I do not quite
know what that means, 'to keep yourself unspotted
from the world,'" resolved her
doubts.</p>

<p>"Well, dear child, read your Bible carefully
and you will find out all about it," exhorted
Mrs. Peters, "I might give you my opinion,
but it is better to get your ideas fresh
from the fountain head. You will find that
those spotless robes hang very high, but not
beyond the reach of the arms of faith."</p>

<p>Our heroine went away deeply pondering
the words of her newly found friend.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<div class="chaphead"><p><b>Daddy's Soliloquy&mdash;A Beer-Soaker&mdash;A
Knock Down Argument&mdash;A Present for Little Wolf.</b></p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/capI.jpg" width="100" height="160" alt="I" title="I" />
</div><p class="dropcap"> guess that ere Sherman won't be
a hanging round the Honey no great
deal after this; if he does I'll put another
flea in his ear fur I ain't a going fur tu
see her throwd away on no beer-soaker."</p>

<p>Thus soliloquized Daddy, as he watched
with evident satisfaction, the hurried departure
of the young gentleman, whom, when we
last left him he had just released from his inevitable
trap.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>A horrible oath sounded in Daddy's ear,
and he lay sprawling on the pavement. "Call
me a beer-soaker again will you," and out
rolled another oath, but Daddy did not hear
it. The fall had stunned him, and he was
taken up insensible.</p>

<p>Absorbed in the subject which was agitating
his mind at the time he received the blow
Daddy had raised his voice to a high pitch,
and, "beer-soaker," rang out loud and clear,
reaching the ear of a passer-by, who, being
pretty well soaked in the beverage mentioned,
or in something stronger, resented the imagined
insult after the manner described.</p>

<p>Proud of his achievement, which he had
just sense enough to see was not generally
approved by the crowd that had gathered
round, Daddy's assailant proceeded defiantly
to defend his cruel deed. "He'd better
never say beer-soaker to me again, the cursed
scoundrel, nor look it either, curse him.
Let any man in this crowd say that he didn't
deserve what he got, and I'll&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You'll come right along with me, my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
friend," and the foolish boaster was marched
off by the city authorities, whom from past
experience, he well knew it was useless to resist.</p>

<p>This same man, now led away amid the
exertions of Daddy's friends, had gone out
from his humble home that beautiful sunny
morning with the solemn promise on his lips
to keep sober for that one day at least. His
hopeful long-suffering wife had watched
lovingly his receding footsteps, as in days,
when a fond husband and father, he always
returned sober. All day long she went trustingly
about her work with kind glad words
to her little children, whose pleased surprise
to receive, as of old, their father's fond caress,
she delighted to imagine.</p>

<p>But alas! it was the old story. The man's
will was too weak to withstand the pursuasions
of drinking companions, and the tempttations
of the liquor seller. He yielded, and,
when once he had got the taste, wife and
children and all were forgotten. At a late
hour that night the little ones were put sadly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
away to bed; the supper table, spread in joy,
was cleared away in sorrow, and the wife
and mother was again doomed to wait, and
watch, and weep.</p>

<p>But let us return to Daddy. Stretched
on a couch of suffering he lies; impatient,
vociferous and generally unmanageable.</p>

<p>"Hurry up that ere doctor afore I die," he
exclaims; "hurry him up I say. Lord, that
ere pain in my shoulder; now its in my long
ribs; now its in my short ribs; I ken feel it
clare down to my heel cord and toe cord.
Take away that ere infernal brandy," he
cried, raising his voice to its highest pitch,
"ye don't spose I want fur to drink pison, do
ye, when I'm most dead already?"</p>

<p>"But it will strengthen you, Daddy," said
the attendant soothingly.</p>

<p>"It won't nuther. It will set me all on
fire and I'll mortify afore the doctor gits
here."</p>

<p>When Dr. Goodrich at length made his
appearance, there was then enacted a scene,
if possible, still more uproarious. Poor Dad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>dy
winced and groaned at every touch, and
oftimes, commanded his physician to desist in
his examinations of the injured parts.
"Don't! Hold on there doctor, you'll yank
me all to bits. There; stop that yanking;
for the lord's sake, doctor, hold on there."</p>

<p>"I am holding on, Daddy," said the doctor
very firmly, as he mended the dislocated
shoulder.</p>

<p>The necessary surgical operation performed,
and an opiate administrated, with the assurance
that no serious results were to be apprehended,
and Daddy's mind and body were
soon at rest.</p>

<p>Meantime, in happy ignorance of Daddy's
accident, Little Wolf and Fanny plodded
homeward; the former deeply absorbed in
thought, the latter blithe and airy, singing
with the birds, and tripping and slipping in
the dissolving snow.</p>

<p>The exuberance of Fanny's delight, however,
began perceptibly to wane as they were
about repassing the spot, where, a few hours
before, they had paused to mourn and lament.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
Again she loitered by her companion's side,
again she sighed, "Poor Fleet Foot;" but
not again did Little Wolf yield to her feelings.
Her tearless eyes looked straight forward,
and she hurried by the frightful gorge,
where lay the remains of her high-mettled
and much loved pet.</p>

<p>On the brow of the hill she paused in surprise,
for again she saw Wycoff with his face
turned towards the brewery. On the present
occasion he was mounted upon his favorite
horse Black Hawk, and, having overtaken
Hank Glutter, the two men were engaged in
a conversation which we will here transcribe.</p>

<p>"How are you, Wycoff? Bound for the
brewery this fine day?"</p>

<p>"Why no, Mr. Glutter, I have about made
up my mind that you have got your share of
my hard earnings this year, I guess I'll pay
up my debts and keep clear of the brewery,
and see how I'll come out about this time
next spring."</p>

<p>"Why, I thought you were doing well
enough, Wycoff," said Hank, uneasily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sure your bill at the brewery is not
large, considering."</p>

<p>"O, I don't complain of the charges, Mr.
Glutter. As Miss DeWolf says, money is not
the only thing you part with at a drinking
saloon."</p>

<p>"O, you're being nosed about by Miss DeWolf,
are you," said Hank contemptuously.</p>

<p>"I had as leif be nosed by a fine lady, as
by a saloon keeper," said Wycoff, drawing
himself up in his saddle.</p>

<p>"D&mdash;&mdash;m the fine lady," said Hank between
his closed teeth, "I'll attend to her
case."</p>

<p>"Shame on the man that will threaten a
lady," said Wycoff hotly.</p>

<p>"When women stoop to interfere with
men's business, they must take the consequences,
Wycoff. Shall I tell you what was
done to a woman who went whining around
trying to raise a prejudice against a respectable
liquor dealer in the place where I once
lived? One dark night her house was pretty
well pelted with stones and brickbats.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
The windows and doors were broken in, and
I do not know what the enraged crowd
would have done had she not made good her
escape."</p>

<p>"A low cowardly set, to attack a defenceless
woman," said Wycoff, "but I've drank
enough myself to know that under the influence
of liquor, men will do almighty mean
things. Every time I've passed the place
where Fleet Foot lays, I have tried to make
up my mind to give up drinking, and pay
Miss De Wolf for the horse, like a man; and
to-day I've come to the sticking point; I have
promised to give up liquor, and in a few minutes
I shall present Black Hawk to Miss DeWolf."</p>

<p>"Well, she had better mind her own business
after this," said Hank with a sneer.
"She has cheated me out of getting a first-rate
clerk this morning. I will not brook her
interference in my affairs. Let her beware,
or I'll make this place too hot for her."</p>

<p>Wycoff's eyes flashed, and he extended his
clenched fist towards Hank. "You will, will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
you?" said he defiantly; "now listen, you
Glutter. If ever you attempt to harm that
lady, I swear to you that this fist of mine
shall batter your brains, and on Black Hawk
she shall ride over your lifeless body."</p>

<p>Black Hawk pawed and snorted and turned
his firey black eyes very wickedly upon
Hank, as if to enforce his master's threat.
He was a most magnificent animal; coal
black, his silken coat, now curried with special
care, shone resplendent in the noon-day
sun.</p>

<p>As Wycoff rode off, Hank muttered to himself,
"She shall never ride that horse."</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Hank had the mortification
of beholding Little Wolf flying past
his door seated, like a little queen, upon
Black Hawk's back.</p>

<p>"She shall never ride that horse again,"
said the enraged saloon keeper, with an oath.</p>

<p>Wycoff had great difficulty in pursuading
Little Wolf to except his present. Indeed
she only consented when she became convinced
that he would be seriously displeased by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
her refusal. Further to gratify the giver, she
took her first ride under his immediate supervision;
and, at his request, she had followed
the road by the brewery, making a circle of
about a quarter of a mile.</p>

<p>"Now that's what I call neatly done," said
Wycoff, as Little Wolf drew up, and leaped
from the saddle. "You are the first lady
that ever backed Black Hawk," he said, patting
the animal's neck. "The fact is, I had
my doubts about your being able to ride him
at all. I was afraid I would have to sell him
and get a gentler beast, and I hated to do
that, for I have raised him from a colt. As
a general thing, he won't allow a stranger to
come nigh him. I had to ride him myself at
the races last September, for everybody was
afraid of him. I won five hundred dollars
on him though. I guess I had better stable
him now; hadn't I? I'll be up here early
to-morrow morning to see how Daddy gets
along with him. I reckon the old man won't
dare to go nigh him till he gets used to him."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<div class="chaphead"><p><b>A Chapter of Accidents and Deliverances.</b></p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 110px;">
<img src="images/capL.jpg" width="110" height="160" alt="L" title="L" />
</div><p class="dropcap">ittle Wolf was glad to see Black
Hawk led away, for she was now thoroughly
weary. The events of the last
twenty-four hours had worn upon her; and
the cozy fire and warm dinner, which awaited
her within, were duly appreciated.</p>

<p>An hour later, nestled upon the parlor sofa
she was burried in profound slumber.
Fanny moved softly about the room, tiptoeing
occasionally to the window to watch for
Daddy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p>Towards night he was brought home on
a stretcher, comfortably arranged in a large
sleigh, Dr. Goodrich accompanying him.
The first intimation that Little Wolf had of
their arrival was a loud ring at the door,
which suddenly roused her from dreams, in
which she was living over again the happiest
moments of her life.</p>

<p>It was some little time before she could
collect her scattered thoughts; but Daddy's
roarings and vociferations at length brought
her to a realizing sense of her responsibilities.</p>

<p>Although assured by his physician that his
hurts would in a few weeks at furthest all be
healed, the old man was not content. He
had a lurking infidelity in regard to the opinions
of the medical profession generally, and,
as soon as Dr. Goodrich had departed, he
confided to Little Wolf his fears.</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, Honey," said he,
"them ere doctors hev been knowd to tell a
pussen that he was a goin fur tu git well, and
just as that pussen had made all his calculations
fur tu live, (and may be git married),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
the fust thing he knew, he would be a dead
man. Now 'tween you and me, its my opinion,
I shan't live twenty-four hours, fur I feel
awful gone like."</p>

<p>"O, its the opiate that makes you feel so,
Daddy. I shall nurse you up and you'll get
well and marry, what's her name?"</p>

<p>"Recta," said Daddy brightening. "Recta,
Miss Orrecta Lippincott. May be, Honey,
with good nussing I shall make out fur tu
stand it. 'Tween you and me, there's nuthin
like good nussin, after the bones is all set
proper."</p>

<p>His wise young nurse did not think it
worth while to remind the invalid that not
one of his bones had been broken, but she
assiduously set herself to work to meet his
accumulating wants. With liniments and
bandages, and cooling drinks, and consoling
words, she stood patiently over him, until
near the midnight hour, he fell asleep.</p>

<p>Shading the lamp, so that scarcely a ray of
light was visible, Little Wolf curled in behind
the window curtain, where she could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
peep through the crevices of the blinds out
on the distant stars and ever shifting clouds,
which in the solitude of the night, speak so
eloquently to the human heart.</p>

<p>Calm and cold was the still hour. The
warm, thawing winds had ceased to blow, the
eaves had ceased their droppings and were
beautifully fringed with icicles. The snow
had become crusted over, but so slightly, indeed,
that the lightest footfall would crush
the treacherous coating, and the cracking of
the icy fragments betray the presence of
prowlers.</p>

<p>By such sounds as we have described,
Little Wolf's meditations were at length disturbed.
Indistinctly at first, but soon with
unmistakable clearness, she recognized approaching
footsteps.</p>

<p>Daddy's room overlooked the stable, and
in that quarter, a human figure was just visible.
Slowly and stealthily it drew near;
and now with dilated eyes and quickly beating
heart, the watcher peered eagerly into
the darkness. Nearer, and still nearer the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
form approached, until close against the
house, just where she could conveniently note
every motion, it paused. A moment of suspense,
and a small flame shot up revealing
Hank Glutter in the act of firing the house.</p>

<p>Quick as thought Little Wolf sprang for
her pistol, which to gratify Daddy she had
stored in his room; and hiding it in the folds
of her dress she flew to meet the incendiary.</p>

<p>During the few seconds consumed in reaching
the spot, Hank had disappeared, and having
strong suspicions that he meditated mischief
to Black Hawk, Little Wolf scattered
the pile of slowly burning faggots, (the fire
not having yet communicated itself to the
building), and made a dash for the stable.</p>

<p>Hank was there just in the act of lighting
a match. He had completely surrounded
Black Hawk with hay and straw, and, in an
instant more, the helpless animal would have
been enveloped in flames.</p>

<p>"Mr. Glutter, the brewery is on fire!"
shouted Little Wolf breathlessly.</p>

<p>The match fell from Hank's nerveless hand,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
for he saw through the wide open door that
the announcement was but too true. To
spring past Little Wolf and rush to secure
his property, was his first thought.</p>

<p>But he was too late. Neither he, nor all
the crowd that quickly gathered there, could
stay the consuming element. The old brewery
burned to the ground, and, for miles
around the country was illuminated by what
to many a poor broken-hearted woman, was
a grand and festive bonfire.</p>

<p>Among the first who discovered the conflagration was Wycoff, and he
was much relieved, on ascertaining the precise location of the fire;
for he had started out filled with apprehensions for Little Wolf. To
his great satisfaction, the old brown house stood out in full relief,
unharmed.</p>

<p>A critical survey of the premises, however,
discovered to him the stable door standing
open, and, by the brilliant blaze, he could
distinctly see Black Hawk, pawing and floundering
in the midst of the hay which Hank
had arranged for his funeral pile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>Quite as distinctly from the upper window
could Little Wolf see the former, and she
hastened to make him acquainted with her
narrow escape and claim his protection.</p>

<p>While he listened, the man's worst passions
were aroused. There was murder in
his heart, and, but for the entreaties of Little
Wolf, another day would never have
dawned upon Hank Glutter.</p>

<p>As for Hank; having the bitter consciousness
that he had brought the calamity upon
himself, he raved and swore like a mad man.
To all questions as to the cause of the fire he
had but one answer, "I suppose I must have
left the confounded lamp too near the bed."
This admission was invariably followed by
oaths and curses, as he passed up and down
before the burning building.</p>

<p>How different were Daddy's emotions! It
was amusing to behold him bolstered up in
bed, exultant to the highest degree. His old
wrinkled face fairly shone with delight, and
he frequently ejaculated as he watched the
progress of the flames, "Thank the Lord God
Almighty, for that dispensation!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p>As the light began to die away, he turned
to Little Wolf and whispered confidentially.
"'Tween you and me, Honey, if I should
happen fur tu hev any children, Recta wont
feel any consarn about the boys gittin to
drinking, now that ere old brewery is out of
the way. Some folks say if a man is tu be a
drunkard, he'll be one any how; but if there's
no liquor, I'd like fur to know how he is going
fur tu git it? I guess nobody ever got
burnt that never see a fire."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<div class="chaphead"><p><b>Another Saloon Scene&mdash;The Bridal
Trousseau&mdash;The Lovely Nurse.</b></p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 110px;">
<img src="images/capA.jpg" width="110" height="160" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><p class="dropcap">s Hank Glutter's was unfortunately not
the only saloon in the world, we will
now open the scene on another place
of the same sort, not many miles away from
the smoking ruins; a place, where, for various
reasons, men did congregate; some to
gratify a vitiated appetite, others simply to
indulge in a social glass, and still others because
they had no where else to go; some because
they were glad, and some because they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
were sad; each and all forgetting the words
of the wise man, "Look not upon the wine."</p>

<p>The door had just opened to admit a small
party of young men. Among the number is
Edward Sherman. There he stands, a little
apart from the rest, just under the chandelier.
Directly opposite, the shelves glitter in
Bohemian and cut glass, and all the attractive
features of the bar. Mark his proud and
lofty bearing, as he steps forward and lifts
the goblet to his lips.</p>

<p>Again, and yet again, the cup goes round,
until no longer he stands firmly among his
companions. See him now, reeling, tottering,
staggering, as he is borne away for the first
time in his life, helplessly intoxicated, borne
to his loving mother, whose grey hairs blanched
whiter in that night of sorrow.</p>

<p>In a desperate mood young Sherman had
permitted himself to be thus overcome, and,
when the effects of the stimulant had worn
off, he strove by the most affectionate attentions
to make amends for the pain he had occasioned
his mother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<p>He even went so far as to bend his proud
spirit to offer something like an apology.</p>

<p>"Mother," said he, as he placed his morning
kiss upon her care worn face, before going
to his office, "do not worry; I shall not
again forget myself. It was foolish, I know,
but I cared not at the time what became of
me. Now don't worry. There is no danger
of me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sherman sighed as the door closed on
her darling. "So like his father," she murmured.</p>

<p>Could she have seen him an hour later, the
resemblance to his father might have struck
her still more forcibly, for the social glass was
again at his lips.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the dear old lady, there
were other claims upon her attention, and,
from a sense of duty, she strove very hard to
bury her anxiety for her son in the folds of
silk and laces which were to constitute the
wedding paraphernalia of her daughter.</p>

<p>Lacking independence of thought, that
young lady relied almost entirely upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
opinion of others, and the consequence was
that not a ribbon, or a flower met her approval
until she had first consulted half a dozen
young friends, who, being apt to differ, kept
her mind in a perpetual tumult.</p>

<p>The mooted question on the morning before
mentioned, was the exact length required
for the bridal veil, Her confidents all
differed in opinion, and, in despair, she appealed
to her mother. "Mamma, Isabel
thinks the veil is two inches too long, and
Clara says it is only half an inch, and Caroline
says it is just right. Now what do you
think?"</p>

<p>"Why, it seems to be entirely a matter of
taste, my dear; perhaps you had better put
it on and ask the doctor's advice."</p>

<p>"O, mamma, the doctor knows nothing at
all about the fashions, and if he did, he would
not follow them I know," said she rather petishly.
"He won't do anything anybody else
does."</p>

<p>"Why, Louise!" said her mother in surprise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't help it, mamma; Ned and I had
set our hearts upon having wine at the wedding,
for it is quite fashionable now, and we
were very sure that we could coax you to let
us, and when I confided in the doctor, and
asked him to use his influence in our favor,
he declared flatly that he would never give
his consent, if it was ever so fashionable. I
declare, it made me almost wish I was going
to marry Charley Horton. You know he and
Isabel Merton are engaged, and the other day
when we were all together, Isabel told me
that she had never asked but one favor of
Charley which he was not willing to grant,
and that was, that he would promise not to
use wine in his family nor offer it to his
friends. She said she felt uncomfortable
whenever she thought of the matter, but she
hoped to be able to influence him to give it
up after they were married. Caroline Wyndam
was there, and she said she would not
<i>dare</i> to say a word to her lover on the subject,
although she would give the world to have
him leave off social drinking. But Clara<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
Hastings and the other girls said they did not
think a little wine or beer would hurt anybody,
and they would not give a fig for a man
that could not control his appetite. Clara
Hastings said if she ever got married, she
would have wine at the wedding. When I
told Ned about it he said Clara was the girl
for him. I wonder what Miss DeWolf would
say to that.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sherman tried to choke down her feelings,
but the bitter, burning tears would come
and one by one they coursed down her withered
cheek.</p>

<p>There was silence for a few minutes, and
Louise would have left the room, but her
mother gently detained her. "Edward wished
me to say to you that his intimacy with
Miss DeWolf was broken off, and he further
requested that you would never mention the
subject to him."</p>

<p>Great consternation was depicted on
Louise's countenance. Oh! it is too bad,"
she exclaimed; "and just as she had promised
to show me how that beautiful trimming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
was made which Miss Marsdon sent her from
New York. I wonder what it means. Do
you know, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Why yes, my dear; it means that Miss
DeWolf is possessed of a sensible, well-balanced
mind, and that your brother has acted
very foolishly."</p>

<p>Just at that moment the conversation was
interrupted by the appearance of one of
Louise's friends and advisers, and the two
girls were soon absorbed in discussing the
merits of some article of dress belonging to
the trousseau.</p>

<p>Thus the hours slipped away, until about
one o'clock, Edward came for dinner. He
knew as soon as his eye rested upon his demonstrative
sister that she had been made
acquainted with his disappointment, and, as
he naturally shrank from receiving sympathy,
either by word or look, he exerted himself
to appear much more cheerful than he really
felt.</p>

<p>Louise inwardly resolved that she would be
very watchful, and not cloud her brother's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
spirits by any allusion whatever to Chimney
Rock, and the next moment she suddenly remembered
having seen at the midnight hour
a very bright light from her chamber window
in that direction. Without second thought,
she related the circumstance, and caught herself
making the inquiry, "Did you see it,
Ned?"</p>

<p>Edward's face flushed scarlet, as he answered
evasively, "O, that was the brewery
on fire. I met Mr. Glutter in the city this
morning. He came to make arrangements to
open another saloon here. I never saw a
man of more indomitable will and perseverance.
Although he lost an immense amount
he is not in the least disheartened."</p>

<p>"Brave fellow," said Louise, cordially embracing
her brother's estimate of the man's
character. "I wonder what occasioned the
fire."</p>

<p>"Why, he placed the lamp too near his
bed, while he went out to learn if there was
any trouble at Miss DeWolf's. It seems that
he had always had a friendly care for her,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
and, hearing noises in that direction, he was
so kind as to run over. Finding it all quiet
about the house, he followed the sounds to
the stable, and discovered that it was only a
horse, which Mr. Wycoff had, a few hours before
presented to Miss DeWolf, that had occasioned
the disturbance. The horse had
broken loose, and just as Mr. Glutter was
fastening him in the stall, he saw the flames
bursting from the saloon; and so his benevolent
trip cost him his brewery."</p>

<p>While Louise was listening with interest to
the recital, Mrs. Sherman and Dr. Goodrich
entered the room. The latter was evidently
disgusted with the expression, "poor fellow,"
that fell once or twice from the lips of the
young lady, and his annoyance reached the
climax when, a moment's pause, she ventured
to assert with one eye on her brother, that
"the poor fellow" would never get any
thanks, "for," said she, "Miss DeWolf detests
him, I know she does."</p>

<p>There was a short, awkward silence, which
Mrs. Sherman broke, by saying, deprecating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>ly
she was sure she could not blame Miss DeWolf
for feeling bitterly towards the saloon
keeper.</p>

<p>"Blame her!" exclaimed Dr. Goodrich,
who could no longer keep silence. "Blame
Miss DeWolf! I would as soon think of
blaming an angel in heaven. What has she
to thank Hank Glutter for, I should like to
know? He whose hands are red in the blood
of her father. He who has made orphans
and widows at her very door. He who has
more than once endangered her very life by
selling those cursed drinks which so infuriate
men. He who would, I doubt not, take her
life this day, if by so doing he could escape
punishment, and add another penny to his
cursed store."</p>

<p>"With your sentiments you are hardly
prepared to do the man justice," said Edward
forestalling a reply upon his sister's pouting
lips.</p>

<p>"Had a man by his nefarious business,
blasted every hope in my Louise's life save<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
one, and were I that one, think you I could
speak favorably of the wretch? No." said
the doctor, impetuously.</p>

<p>Louise, partially restored to good humor,
had managed to slip behind her brother,
where she stood making all sorts of admonitory
gestures to her lover, who had not as yet,
been let into the secret of the change in his
friends's relation to Little Wolf.</p>

<p>But the doctor could not; or would not
take Louise's hints, and he went on hotly.
"Curse the business! I say. Curse the man,
who, with his eyes open to the consequences,
engages in it. The law could, and should,
make him responsible. Hank Glutter is the
man who ought to have been compelled to
indemnify Miss DeWolf for the losses she sustained
on that dreadful day when Wycoff
came so near dashing her over the precipice.
It was he who tempted the man to drink, until
he became drunk, and did the mischief,
to repair which he sacrificed his favorite
horse. Thank God it was by Hank's own
confession, the animal's noise that brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
about the burning of the brewery. It is some
comfort that God now and then legislates on
the traffic, when men will not."</p>

<p>The doctor paused, and, as no one seemed
inclined to make any comments, he began to
speak more calmly, and on a subject which
he flattered himself would be more agreeable.</p>

<p>"I have just been down to bind up Daddy's
bruises," he said, "but his lovely nurse
had done all that was necessary. Then turning
to Edward with a meaning smile, "Ned,
she is a right regal nurse. I almost wished
myself in Daddy's place this morning. It
must be very consoling in hours of pain to
have a little angel smoothing your pillow,
and hovering over you with sweet words and
gentle touches."</p>

<p>The doctor suddenly stopped short. There
was an expression of sharp agony on Edward's
face that could not be mistaken.
Louise had never looked on him so before.
Added to her sympathy for her brother, was
an indefinable pang occasioned by her lover's
warm praises of another. Mrs. Sherman,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
the picture of distress, looked helplessly from
one to the other.</p>

<p>The dinner bell was at that moment a welcome
sound.</p>

<div class="chaphead"><p><b>Threats&mdash;Little Wolf and Black
Hawk&mdash;Tragic Death of Hank Glutter.</b></p></div>

<img src="images/capH.jpg" width="110" height="160" alt="H" title="H" />
</div><p class="dropcap">is business arrangements satisfactorily
completed, towards night, Hank Glutter
was seen setting out for Chimney
Rock.</p>

<p>To say the truth, he appeared secretly uneasy,
glancing furtively behind at every
sound as he hurried forward like one pursued.
By, and by, out on the solitary highway he
walked on with more confidence, and finally,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
after assuring himself that he was quite alone,
began to let fall some very energetic expressions
in which were mingled the names of
Miss DeWolf, of Black Hawk and of Wycoff.</p>

<p>"She shall never ride Black Hawk again,"
he muttered, "Miss DeWolf can't circumvent
me. If she has dared to betray me, she
will never tell the story again. I guess my
word is as good as hers&mdash;I defy Wycoff."
Then followed such expletives as the speaker
deemed suitable to the occasion: but which
were suddenly interrupted by the appearance
of Mr. Wycoff mounted upon Black Hawk
and apparently in good humor with himself
and all the world.</p>

<p>He evidently did not wish to remember the
unpleasant scene of the previous day, for he
partly halted as he came up to Hank, and
said pleasantly, "What luck to-day, Mr.
Glutter?"</p>

<p>Hank seeing in him a future victim to his
wiles, spread his net right warily: "Well,
Wycoff," he replied," "I have had the good
luck to secure the most desirable corner in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
the city for my business, and I intend to keep
on hand first class liquors, just such as you
like best; and I consider you a judge of the
article."</p>

<p>"How unfortunate that I have given up
drinking," said Wycoff with great gravity.</p>

<p>The corners of Hank's mouth drew down a
little, but he replied in the most persuasive
manner, "O well, its never best to drink to
excess, but I hope to have the pleasure, Mr.
Wycoff, of treating you to many a harmless
glass."</p>

<p>"I must be going back," said Wycoff,
abruptly wheeling round, "I just rode out a
little way to get some of the spirit out of the
horse before Miss DeWolf takes her evening
ride."</p>

<p>Hank shook his fist after him, "I'll take
the spirit out of the horse, and out of the girl
too," he threatened. "Lucky she hasn't told
Wycoff, I can tell my own story all the better."</p>

<p>Hank had just entered the "pass" when he
again caught a view of Black Hawk in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
distance; but this time Little Wolf was the
rider. He drew his breath hard, and in an
instant his hand was upon his dirk. "Now
is my time," came from between his closed
teeth and he threw himself behind the trunk
of a tree, and in the twilight not a shadow of
him was visible.</p>

<p>On came Little Wolf, sitting her splendid
steed right regally. Her proud, fearless little
face was slightly shaded by the waving
plumes in her velvet cap, and her long black
robes floated on the evening breeze.</p>

<p>By constant petting from the hour that he
became hers, Black Hawk had been won, and
the intractable, fiery creature, who had hitherto
spurned all control but Wycoff's, readily
yielded to Little Wolf's guiding hand. The
sagacious creature had exhibited no little
pride in bearing off his precious burden under
the eye of his old master. His new mistress
glorying in her power over him bade
him forward and without a suspicion of danger,
entered the fatal pass.</p>

<p>In a moment they were opposite Hank's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
hiding place, who concentrating all his energies,
made a cat-like spring and caught at
Black Hawk's bridle.</p>

<p>To sheer off, rear high in the air, and plant
his fore foot right into the would-be-murderer's
brain, was a feat performed without a
sign from Little Wolf, who sat like one paralyzed,
while Black Hawk in a fury trampled
their assailant under his feet. She saw
Hank's ghastly face and flaxen ringlets go
down, and she saw his life blood spurting far
over the pure white snow, and the next instant
she was borne swiftly away from the
terrible scene.</p>

<p>For some little time Black Hawk had it all
his own way, and they were far out on the
main traveled road to Pendleton before Little
Wolf made an effort to check his speed.
But suddenly she drew the rein with no gentle
hand.</p>

<p>They had overtaken a lady and gentleman,
who were riding leisurely, evidently quite
absorbed in each other's society. One quick,
searching glance revealed the parties to Lit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>tle
Wolf; and she curled her lip in scorn, as
she saw those attentions which Edward had
so lately lavished upon herself, now given to
Clara Hastings.</p>

<p>Well might Edward start and strain his
eyes after the retreating figure to which the
loud clatter of hoofs had called his attention,
for fleeing fast away was one in whose true
heart, he had planted still another arrow,
which would there rankle long, spite of the
vow of eternal forgetfulness even then upon
her proud lips.</p>

<p>In order to avoid "The Pass," and its horrors,
Little Wolf took a circuitous route
home. She emerged from the wild, unbroken
path through the forest just as Wycoff
was begining to feel seriously uneasy at her
prolonged absence.</p>

<p>He eagerly caught at the bridle, "I was
afraid Black Hawk had been playing pranks,"
he said, patting the animal's neck: "Why,
here's blood upon the beast; I guess he's got
rubbed agin a tree. It wan't exactly safe to
come that way, anyhow, but girls will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
girls, there's a natural tendancy in 'em to go
into crooked ways," and Wycoff laughed, as
he thought that he had perpetrated a good
joke, and looked at Little Wolf as if he expected
her too appreciate it.</p>

<p>"It is Mr. Glutter's blood," gasped Little
Wolf, "he attempted to stop us in the Pass,
and Black Hawk trampled upon him."</p>

<p>"Oh! that's it, eh?" said Wycoff. "A
knowing critter, that. He's got the instincts
of a woman, and I ain't sure but he knows
as much as a man. Well, I hope Hank is
dead, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say so, Mr. Wycoff," said Little
Wolf, every particle of color forsaking her
face.</p>

<p>"Well, now if I ain't beat," said the rough
man, "I thought you would be tickled to
dance on Hank's grave."</p>

<p>Little Wolf turned silently away and went
into the house.</p>

<p>"Well, well," and Wycoff bent a look of
inquiry upon Sorrel Top, who had been out
sharing his solicitude for her mistress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess she feels kinder horrible like,
about seeing him mashed," was Sorrel Top's
explanatory reply.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll jest go round and see what his
condition is, anyhow."</p>

<p>While Wycoff was on his mission and Little
Wolf shut up in her room, Sorrel Top
hastened to communicate the news to Daddy.</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me I'm glad on't," said
Daddy, exultingly. I hope he's dead."</p>

<p>"Well, now, that's heathenish, Daddy, to
wish a feller critter dead."</p>

<p>"He wan't no feller critter," said Daddy,
indignantly, "he was nothin' but a liquor-seller:
the wust kind tu, fur he knowed just
what mischief he wus a doing to the human
race. Yes, and to the brute race tu, fur I've
seen men whallop their hosses nigh about tu
death when they was in liquor."</p>

<p>"I've seen 'em wallop 'em when they want
in liquor," said Sorrel Top, determined as
usual to combat Daddy at all hazards.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, sich men ain't feller
critters, nuther, I reckon they'll live next
door to liquor sellers, by and by," said Daddy,
with self righteous-assurance.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know where you expect to go
when you die?" said Sorrel Top, with a toss
of the head."</p>

<p>"Why, I'll go tu that ere place where
folks go that du the best they know."</p>

<p>"Well, you're lucky if you can say you
have always done the best you could," said
the other in a tone which clearly indicated a
doubt of Daddy's entire veracity.</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, I've been thinking
that I might hev been more active in the
temperance cause. I guess afore long I'll git
up a temperance lectur and go round deliverin'
of it."</p>

<p>"O, pshaw, you wouldn't git no <i>ordiance</i>.
Would he Fanny?" said Sorrel Top, appealing
to Fanny Green, who had been a silent
but not uninterested listener to the conversation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess he would," said Fanny, hopefully,
"I would attend."</p>

<p>"Of course you would," said Daddy, excitedly,
"and the Honey would too."</p>

<p>"Well, you couldn't tell me nothing more
than I know on that pint," said Sorrel Top,
flinging herself out of the room with an air
of unqualified contempt.</p>

<p>Left alone with Daddy, Fanny ventured to
say softly, "Daddy have you ever prayed
about it?"</p>

<p>"About what, Fanny?"</p>

<p>"Why, about people's drinking and selling
liquor and those things that you talk about?"</p>

<p>"Pray about it? why no. What should I
pray about it fur? I never pray about nothing."</p>

<p>Fanny looked shocked. "Don't you know
the Bible tells us to pray, Daddy?"</p>

<p>"Well, I spose it does," Daddy admitted,
"but somehow I hev never said my prayers,
since I was a little shaver; I reckon it don't
do no good fur tu pray, no how. My religion
is tu do the best I ken."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, Daddy, if God tells you to ask for
what you want, and you don't do it, is that
doing the best you can?"</p>

<p>"I ruther guess you've got the best of old
Daddy, this ere time," said the old man,
stroking the child's sunny locks. "'Tween
you and me, Fanny, I don't know nothin' at
all about the Bible. My father and mother
died afore I was old enough fur tu read, and
I was bound tu a man that didn't gin me a
big edication, I never seen a Bible in his
house,"</p>

<p>"Then you don't know about Jesus
Christ?" said Fanny, quite pitifully</p>

<p>"Laws yes, I've heern ministers preach a
leetle about him once in a while when I went
to church fur tu go hum with Recta; but,
somehow, I want much took up with him."</p>

<p>"O, but Daddy, you would have been if
you had understood that he was the best
friend you ever had. My mamma used to
tell me how he came to die for us, and how
we could not get to Heaven without him. I
will tell you all about it, Daddy, shall I? I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
told Miss DeWolf, yesterday, and she looked
real glad."</p>

<p>"Laws, Fanny, the Honey is high edicated
and knows a heap more than we do."</p>

<p>"O, yes, of course, Daddy, but then she
had never heard it just as mamma used to
tell it; for you know mamma talked just as
if she had lived in the same house with Him,
and He had told her Himself all about the
beautiful place for all those that He can take
there."</p>

<p>"Well, He may take me," said Daddy.</p>

<p>"O, but you will have to ask him to take
you, Daddy," said his little instructress, opening
wide her eyes.</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, there's the stick,
Fanny, I really don't know how fur tu ask
him."</p>

<p>"Why, Daddy, how would you ask him for
bread if you were starving?"</p>

<p>"I calculate I'd beg mighty hard if I was
in sich a tight place."</p>

<p>Fanny's eyes filled, and Daddy feeling rather
uncomfortable, patted her cheek tenderly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're a fust rate leetle gal, Fanny," he
said, "and I'm kinder thinking I'll look into
this ere matter by and by, when I get my
lectur writ."</p>

<p>"May be, if you should ask Him, God
would make you think what is the best thing
to say in your lecture," persisted the child.</p>

<p>"Laws, Fanny, I ken think of them ere
things myself. All the help I want is a leetle
mite from you about the spellin.</p>

<p>"Wycoff now appeared looking very grave
and reported Hank, "stone dead."</p>

the first fierce glance of the sun, the
sensitive snow dissolved in tears; but
he was forced to call to his aid the strong
winds to blow long upon the ice-bound river,
ere it yielded and permitted the beautiful
steamers again to ride upon its throbbing
bosom.</p>

<p>There were those who eagerly counted the
weeks that brought about these changes, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
each hour drew them nearer to their bridal
morning, and one fair May day, when the
earth was decked in her garments of green,
Louise Sherman, arrayed in her bridal robes,
was led by Dr. Goodrich to the marriage altar.</p>

<p>Edward Sherman also was there, to celebrate
the same rite, for, in a few short weeks
he had wooed and won Miss Clara Hastings.
It was with no small degree of pride, that he
looked upon that tall, elegant woman and
called her wife.</p>

<p>Clara was equally proud of her husband.
Talented, handsome, and, as she supposed,
on the road to wealth, she asked no more.
Thus they set out in life together.</p>

<p>The ceremony over, the wedding parties,
including Mrs. Sherman, started on a tour to
the old homestead, where it was their intention
to pass a few weeks, and finally to
change it for a permanent home in Minnesota.</p>

<p>They had given Recta timely notice of
their coming, and, had she had no interruption,
the housekeeper's preparations would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
indeed have been elaborate. She had received
and answered Daddy's letter favorably,
and was in daily expectation of a second communication
from the same source. The plan
which she had arranged in her own mind was
to remain until after the arrival of the family,
and then to spend a few weeks with a married
sister, whose assistance she would require
in the preperation of her bridal outfit. As a
general thing Recta's head was pretty clear,
but in this case, she did not count upon the
proverbial impetuosity of a widower, and,
consequently, signally failed.</p>

<p>One bright morning, when all the bed and
table linen, and every bleachable thing to be
found in the house, were spread upon the
grass; when feather beds and blankets, and
carpets, were hung out to air; when soap-suds
and white-wash stood side by side;
when the china closet had disgorged its treasures,
and the silver was spread out for extra
polishing; when all the ingredients for a
mammoth fruit cake were marshalled on the
kitchen table; when chairs and other furni<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>ture
were gathered in clusters, as if discussing
the general uproar; when poor old Lilly
Foot had been driven forth with a sharp reproof
and a cold breakfast, and forlorn kitty,
hid away in a dark corner, where only her
green eyes were visible, mewed disconsolate,
a loud knock was heard at the door.</p>

<p>"I do wonder who is going to hinder me
now?" fretted Recta, as lifting her dripping
hands from her scrubbing suds, and drying
them upon her apron she obeyed the summons.</p>

<p>At the first glance at the intruder she recognized
Daddy, and turning pale and then
red by turns, she sank speedily into a chair.</p>

<p>How changed were both since they last
met. She was then a blooming, brown haired,
rather coquettishly dressed country girl,
and he black haired, dapper and gay. Now
he beheld her in faded calico, sallow, wrinkled
and grey; and she looked upon a white
haired, shrivelled up, little old man.</p>

<p>Both were for the moment, silent and disappointed,
but Daddy was the first to recov<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>er
his presence of mind. "'Tween you and
me, don't you know me, Recta?"</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon I do, Philip," said Recta
instinctively covered her face with her apron.</p>

<p>A smile of delight broke over Daddy's features,
and his first disappointment was forgotten.
"That's jest as you used to sarve
me, Recta; now I'm agoin fur tu sarve you
one of my old tricks," and, by an adroit
movement to which he encountered a very
slight resistance, Recta's features were again
visible.</p>

<p>There was a deep red spot on either cheek,
and she looked rather foolish, but it was not
long before the old lovers were living over
again their youthful hours.</p>

<p>Oblivious of the flight of time, the mid-day
sun shone in upon them, still absorbed in
each other. It would be impossible to say
how long this state of things might have continued
had not Daddy inadvertantly called
Recta's attention to her household duties.</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, I want fur tu git
married afore night," he was saying, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
Recta suddenly sprang to her feet in dire
dismay.</p>

<p>"Why Philip," she exclaimed, "how can
I get married and all this work on hand?"</p>

<p>"I'm kinder thinkin we ken hev the job
did, and then I ken help you fur to do the
work."</p>

<p>Recta, demurred, but overwhelmed with
persuasions, she finally consented to confer
with her sister, living near by, and the result
was, they were married before night, which
fully accorded with Daddy's desires.</p>

<p>The next morning the atmosphere of the
house had materially changed: but the aspect
not. Lilly Foot luxuriated on a warm
breakfast, and strutted about the house complacently
wagging his tail, and green-eyed
pussy purred contentedly behind the kitchen
stove.</p>

<p>But still confronting Recta was the untouched
white-wash, unwashed china, unpolished
silver, unmade cake, and the undone
condition of things generally.</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, I wouldn't go fur tu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
du no work to-day," advised Daddy, as Recta
made a movement towards setting the
house in order.</p>

<p>"I reckon, Philip, Miss Sherman will be
here in a few days, and I wouldn't get ketched
in this plight for nothing.</p>

<p>"You ain't a mite like mammy was," said
Daddy, holding affectionately on to Recta's
dress. "Laws, she would jerk herself away
from me, and afore I knowd it be a flying
around the house like a whirl-wind, orderin
me round 'till I didn' know what fur tu du
fust."</p>

<p>"O, well, you must let me go now, Philip,"
said Recta, good-naturedly, "or I won't git
nothing done to-day. Now don't tech me
again until I git them dishes washed and sot
up."</p>

<p>"Laws, Recta, don't ask me fur tu wait
that long; I'd like fur tu help you, so you'd
get through quicker. Now set me tu work,
du,"</p>

<p>"Well, Philip, them things on the line<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
ought to be brought in. I forgot 'em last
night."</p>

<p>"'Tween you an' me, what made ye forgit
'em?" said Daddy, mischievously.</p>

<p>"I reckon when anybody is tagged to me
every minute, I can't remember nothing,
Philip."</p>

<p>At this mild rebuke Daddy laughed immoderately,
but he was none the less at her
heels. Turn whichever way she would, he
was always there, and consequently her work
progressed slowly; so slowly, indeed, that the
bridal party arrived, and found her illy prepared
to meet them.</p>

<p>But when the circumstances became
known, she was at once absolved from all
blame, and loaded with congratulations and
presents made wondrously happy.</p>

<p>As their services were indispensable, it was
decided that the useful old couple should remain
through the breaking up and moving
season.</p>

<p>While the younger portion of the household
gave themselves up to a succession of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
pleasure parties given in their honor, Daddy
and Recta spent their evenings in social chat
by the kitchen fire. At such times Daddy
was the chief speaker, and Recta never wearied
of listening to his wonderful stories.</p>

<p>Especially was she interested in Little
Wolf's career. Her wonderful escape from
Bloody Jim, her triumphal ride over Hank
Glutter, her astonishing beauty, talents, and
virtues were subjects upon which he descanted
with great fluency.</p>

<p>"'Tween you an' me, Recta," said he, being
in an uncommonly confidential frame on
one of these occasions, "I used fur tu think
that are Edward Sherman was a hanging
around the Honey, and I sot myself tu put a
stop to it, and that are day I was knocked
down, and had my shoulder put out of jint,
I jest gin him a hint that a nice young man
was a goin fur tu git her."</p>

<p>"Why, Philip, I thought Edward was
about the nicest young man in the world,"
Recta ventured to assert.</p>

<p>Daddy elevated his eyebrows, and hitch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>ing
up very close to his companion, whispered,
"'Tween you an' me, didn't you know he
drunk nothin?"</p>

<p>"You don't say so, Philip!" exclaimed
Recta, in tones in which were blended surprise
and grief.</p>

<p>"I've seed him," declared Daddy, decidedly.</p>

<p>"Dear me, how I wish he had always staid
to home. Dear me, I can't bear to have it
so; he was such a sweet little feller, when I
nussed and tended on him. He don't drink
hard, does he, Philip?"</p>

<p>"I guess about middlin. I never seed him
dead drunk, but I've ketched him a few
times about as full as he could hold. He
cum hum pretty tight from the party last
night."</p>

<p>"You don't say! I guess that's what's
made his mother so low-spirited all day."</p>

<p>"I kinder think that are wife of hisen don't
feel nun tu nice over it nuther, fur she 'pears
ruther down in the mouth. I happened fur
tu hear her a tellin him this morning, that fur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
tu drink moderate was genteel, but tu over
drink was vulgar. It's my opinion he ain't
got a fur-seein woman, or she wouldn't hev
preached no sech doctrine as that are. You
wouldn't have ketched the Honey a doin of
it; she thinks it's all vulgar and wicked tu."</p>

<p>"I think it's a sin to pass it around at
them parties, Philip."</p>

<p>"Sartin, Recta; young fellers will get a
liking for it, and get ruined in that are way."</p>

<p>"I don't see what makes folks do it when
they know it's such dangerous practice."</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, it's the devil," said
Daddy bluntly. "He has allers tempted good
folks as well as bad with his pison. He manages
somehow fur tu make 'em believe there
ain't no harm in it. I should think nobody
could help a knowin of it. I heered some
women talkin on the steamer, and one of 'em
said she knowed a lady what was in the habit
of treating gentlemen friends to all sorts of
fancy drinks, and she was a real nice lady,
tu, and got lots of 'em to attend her church
jest by them means. They said it was so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
popular to drink wine now-a-days, that the
best of folks didn't think there was no harm
in it."</p>

<p>"That was the common way of thinking
when I was young. I remember very clear
when the minister used to come here with the
judge, and the judge was very apt to go off
and have a spree after it. Miss Sherman
mourned herself most to death, but when
the minister came out strong on the side of
temperance and preached and practised, and
the judge had signed the pledge, we had different
times, I tell you. Them decanters
have stood empty on the side board ever
since."</p>

<p>"I wish, they were smashed," said Daddy,
emphatically.</p>

<p>"So do I," echoed Recta. "I'd like to
sarve 'em as the heathen do their idols when
they git converted to Christianity."</p>

<p>"Be you a Christian, Recta."</p>

<p>Recta looked down confusedly, twirled her
thumbs, and finally answered in a constrained
tone, "I belong to the church."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>

<p>"Du ye? well, may be I'll jine it tu. I
promised Fanny fur tu tend tu that are matter
when I got my lectur done, but I hed fur
to tend tu gittin married fust."</p>

<p>"Your what done, Philip?"</p>

<p>"My lectur, I writ one on temperance
when I was sick. I calculate fur tu go round
deliverin of it next winter when we git settled.
'Tween you and me, I may clare a little
money on it. Lecturers are apt tu, I've
heern say."</p>

<p>"You had better lectur on cabbages if you
want tu make money on it," was the wise response.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/capT.jpg" width="100" height="160" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p class="dropcap">he old brown house was desolate; the
doors bolted, the shutters closed, and
not a sound to be heard within its walls.
The stable too, was deserted, for now Black
Hawk freely roamed in the pastures of his
former master.</p>

<p>But in more ways than one had he done
our heroine good service. Day after day,
during that unhappy Spring she had, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
striving to banish thought, ridden him
through the wildest of wild forest paths, reckless
alike of her own safety and his. The
noble animal forded swollen streams, floundered
through treacherous sloughs, leaped over
fallen trees and climbed rocky precipices, and
had not heaven ordained it otherwise, both
horse and rider must have fallen a prey to
the dangers of the way.</p>

<p>Although indulging in this abandonment
of feeling, Little Wolf neglected none of her
duties. Indeed, she seemed determined
never to let a moment escape unoccupied.
While Daddy was confined to his room, and
Mrs. Peters lived, she faithfully supplied their
wants, but after the former became convalescent,
and started for his wife, and the latter
went to her last rest, blessing her benefactress
with her latest breath, she had no one
but Fanny on whom to bestow her care, except,
indeed, Mrs. Peters' grandson Charley,
for whom she soon obtained a desirable situation.</p>

<p>About this time, she received repeated and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
pressing invitations from her much loved
school friend, Miss Marsden, to accompany
herself and brother on a tour to California,
upon which they expected to set out sometime
in June. The marriage of Sorrel Top,
with whom she had made arrangements for
Fanny Green to remain, until such times as
Daddy and his wife should return and take
possession of the old homestead, and the
charge of the child was most opportune: for
she was now at liberty to avail herself of the
change so affectionately urged upon her.</p>

<p>In addition to the allusions before made to
Alfred and Annie Marsden, we will here simply
state, that the brother and sister were
orphans, and heirs of considerable property, a
part of which consisted in an elegant city residence.
Here they had lived since the death
of their parents, which occured a short time
previous to the period when Little Wolf and
their daughter left school together.</p>

<p>The son, a bachelor of about thirty, had, a
number of years before, visited Minnesota in
quest of health. His proclivity for hunting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
and fishing led him to the vicinity of Chimney
Rock, and he it was, who, when she was
a small child, rescued Little Wolf from the
hands of Bloody Jim.</p>

<p>But this was his own secret most carefully
guarded from our heroine, who, during her
former visit had learned to regard him in the
light of an elder brother; but, as will be seen
hereafter his feelings towards her were of a
warmer character.</p>

<p>Having, therefore, paid a flying visit to St.
Paul, and wept her adieus upon the bosom
of her sympathizing friend, Mrs. Tinknor,
having pouted at Tom, and made her financial
arrangements with the Squire, we now
behold Little Wolf in the embrace of one,
who had so long stretched forth her arms to
receive her.</p>

<p>The first raptures over, we hear Miss Marsden
saying, "we will never part with our
Little Wolf again, will we, brother?"</p>

<p>The response is, "Not if I can help it."</p>

<p>We know not why, it may have been that
these words of affection, brought suddenly to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
her mind all that she had loved and lost, or
she might have intuitively divined young
Marsden's sentiments towards her, we only
know that her lip quivered, and she trembled
and grew pale and sank helpless upon the
sofa.</p>

<p>Her extreme agitation created in her friends
no little alarm, but it soon passed off, and as
they could not but observe that any futher
allusion to the matter was annoying to her,
the brother and sister exchanged expressive
glances which, being interpreted, signified,
"resolved that the subject be indefinitely
postponed." But it was again mooted on the
first occasion of the absence of their guest;
Miss Marsden being the first to bring it under
consideration.</p>

<p>"O, it was only fatigue," said her brother,
in reply to her various surmises.</p>

<p>"No, it was not fatigue," she insisted with
an arch smile. "It is my opinion she was
laboring under some powerful emotion. I
once saw her almost as much agitated in one
of our school exhibitions, in which she was to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
act a prominent part; but she went through
it splendidly, the determined little thing."</p>

<p>"O well, it might have been excess of joy
at meeting you."</p>

<p>"At meeting <i>me</i>, do you say, sir? Now
brother, don't try to crawl out of it, for I
have determined to extort the truth from you.
Was she not overjoyed at meeting <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, my dear sister, the truth is, I
think not. You must have noticed she takes
special pains to address me as brother, and
always to treat me as such, and you young
ladies rarely faint at the sight of a brother."</p>

<p>"O, but you are only an adopted brother,"&mdash;slyly.</p>

<p>"That's all," sighed the young man.</p>

<p>"I think her father's death has changed her
a little. She appears more thoughtful and
womanly: don't she brother?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be surprised if she were in
love," suggested the other.</p>

<p>"O fie, brother, she's not in love, unless it
be with you; or she would have confided it
to me. Moreover," she continued, seeing an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
incredulous smile playing upon her brother's
lips, "you must yourself admit that it would
be a very strange freak for a young lady in
love to voluntarily put the ocean between
herself and the object of her affections. I
verily believe our Little Wolf is more anxious
if possible, to start on the tour than we
are."</p>

<p>"Yes, so do I," admitted her brother, "and
I can't account for it."</p>

<p>"O, it is simply to run away from Mr. Alfred
Marsden," was the ironic reply.</p>

<p>"I do assure you, sister, that you greatly
mistake our mutual sentiments."</p>

<p>"Not yours, certainly, brother, and I think
not hers; but I'll find out."</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, don't broach the
matter to her, sister," said young Marsden in
alarm, "It would spoil all the pleasure of our
trip. Indeed, I know she would not go at
all."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, brother, do you think me a
goose? I would not be so indelicate; no indeed.
There are more ways than you have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
dreamed of, for ferreting out a love secret."</p>

<p>"O yes, I know such secrets develope
themselves in a thousand forms, and if there
is anything of that nature in her breast it will
transpire in due time."</p>

<p>"It was not long before the young man's
prediction came near proving true, and thus
it happened.</p>

<p>"The two young ladies, Annie and Little
Wolf were out shopping, and becoming wearied,
they stepped into a fashionable place of
resort for rest and refreshment. While waiting,
a small party, two ladies and a gentleman,
came in and were seated at a table not
far removed from their own. Little Wolf's
back was to the party, but Annie, being opposite
her friend, faced them.</p>

<p>At the first sound of their voices, Little
Wolf turned partly round, and behold there
was Edward Sherman with his wife and sister.
Her movement not having been observed,
she was unrecognized by the trio. But
so violently did she tremble and so deathly
was her countenance, that Annie would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
betrayed her by an exclamation of alarm, had
not a warning gesture from Little Wolf stayed
the word upon her lips.</p>

<p>In a moment Little Wolf recovered herself
sufficiently to write upon her tablets, "Do
not speak to me, Annie, I do not wish to be
known by the party opposite."</p>

<p>"Annie read the request, and returned the
answer, "You will faint, let me order wine."</p>

<p>"No, I shall not faint," wrote Little Wolf's
trembling fingers, and her erect little figure
involuntarily drew itself up.</p>

<p>"Poor things, they are mutes;" said
Louise, compassionately regarding the means
of communication between the silent young
ladies.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sherman assented, and the lively
young bride's acting on this supposition, imposed
no restraint upon their conversation.
They talked about the past, and unveiled
their future plans; sipped their fancy drinks
and ate cake while Little Wolf and Miss
Marsden vigorously plied their pencils.</p>

<p>Edward alone remained unoccupied except<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
indeed, the use he was making of his eyes,
and they were riveted upon Little Wolf. He
was watching those busy little hands, and
there came over him a strange feeling of heart
sickness, as he saw on one dimpled finger a
well remembered ring, a golden hoop with
diamonds uniquely set in pearls. It was a
relic of the past, having been presented to
Little Wolf's mother on her wedding day.
He knew well it's history, for the present
owner had told it to him, and blushed when
he said to her, "My Little Wolf will wear
another on her wedding day."</p>

<p>Then, in the thought there was bliss, now,
naught but anguish.</p>

<p>The longer he gazed, the more he became
convinced that it was none other than Little
Wolf whom he saw, and anxious to conceal
the fact from his wife and sister, he made a
hasty movement to leave.</p>

<p>"Why, Edward, what possesses you?" exclaimed
his wife, "going already, and your
wine untasted. I believe you are crazy. Sit
still a moment, I'm not ready. The stimu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>lant
hasn't got into my feet, but I feel it going
down. Come, do drink a little, you look
as pale as a ghost."</p>

<p>"Do, brother," chimed in Louise, "I feel
a great deal brighter; but don't tell the doctor
I have been taking anything strong."</p>

<p>"Strong," repeated Clara, "I hope you
don't call a little light claret, strong."</p>

<p>"O no, I don't, but the doctor does, and I
may as well keep his mind easy," replied
Louise.</p>

<p>Edward had risen to his feet, and waited
silently but evidently impatiently.</p>

<p>"Can't I persuade you to take a little before
we go? Do; you look so pale this
morning," persisted Mrs. Sherman, herself
lifting the goblet towards her husband.</p>

<p>Determined not to have any more words,
Edward hastily drank the proffered beverage,
and immediately left the place.</p>

<p>When they had fairly disappeared, Little
Wolf sank back in her chair, and breathed
hard as if awaking from a terrible night
mare.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, I was so afraid they would discover
me," she gasped. "They were once good
friends of mine," she continued with an effort
at composure, "but you won't care will you,
dear good Annie, if I don't tell you how it
came to be otherwise?"</p>

<p>Annie looked a little disappointed, but she
magnanimously put Little Wolf at her ease by
saying, "No indeed, for I'm sure it was no
fault of yours."</p>

<p>In absence of evidence, Annie of course,
put her own construction on what had occured,
and mentally voted Edward a villain, and
his wife and sister his accomplices. This
opinion she expressed to her brother, when
in an hour of confidence, she glowingly pictured
the scene.</p>

<p>"I think the young man must be at the
bottom of the mischief," she said, "for he
was even more agitated than Little Wolf.
He had recognized her from the first, although
I cannot devine how, for she sat with her
back to them."</p>

<p>"I would have known her among a thous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>and,"
cried young Marsden, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"O, then, I suppose he must have been an
old lover," said his sister mischievously.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">s the most agreeable method of conveying
to the reader a correct account
of Little Wolf's adventures, and personal
feelings during her journeying, we will
quote largely from letters addressed from time
to time to her friend, Mrs. Tinknor.</p>

<p>"From the first we take the following:</p>

<p>"While I write, the Captain's little daugh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>ter
sits beside me. We have met several
times on the hurricane deck&mdash;Flora and I&mdash;and
are on quite intimate terms, considering
the shortness of our acquaintance. The first
twenty four hours she was seasick, 'wery,
wery sick,' she informed me, and her pale
face bore traces of the ordeal through which
she had passed; and, indeed, the countenances
of most of the passengers are suggestive
of Tompsonian doctors. To such, our three
days at sea must have been uncommonly disagreeable,
the weather having been rough the
entire period. Yesterday, we were favored
with a storm. The commencement was most
sublime, but all having been unwillingly ordered
below I was borne resisting into the
cabin and the splendid exhibition of nature
shut from my view, of course I could not keep
on my feet, but I managed to climb upon a
stand, and holding on with all my might, I
could see the waves through the port hole
run mountains high, and what silly thing do
you think I did? I actually cried with vexation,
shut up in that miserable place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was as if Black Hawk had been bearing
me exultant on a wild gallop in the face
of winds that shook the very foundations of
the earth, and, the loftiest enthusiasm having
been enkindled, I was suddenly plunged into
a sickening, stifling, dismal cavern, and shut
out from light and liberty.</p>

<p>"I made frantic assaults upon the porthole,
and the remonstrances of the ship carpenter,
who chanced to spy me, would have
availed him nothing had he not forcibly lifted
me down, and seated me upon the floor of
my state-room.</p>

<p>"The miserable creature imagined me
frightened out of my senses. 'No immediate
danger Miss,' said he, 'compose yourself; the
ship will right up directly&mdash;throwing all the
light trash overboard&mdash;chicken coops just
gone over.'</p>

<p>"'Man,' moaned a woman on whose face
was blended an expression of benevolence
and nausea, 'did you open those coops, and
let out those fowls, that they may not drift
about and starve?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p>"'The sea, madam,' said the builder of
ships, grandly, 'the sea has swallowed them
coops and all.'</p>

<p>"Miss Flora has just asked me if my letter
is not most finished, 'for,' said the cunning
little elf 'you might put in that papa called
you a stubborn little wretch yesterday, when
you wouldn't go down to the cabin.'</p>

<p>"I wonder if he dared to say it, I suppose
I looked incredulous, for the little mischief
continues to reiterate the assertion, but she
consolingly adds, 'He was wery, wery angry
then, and he knew you wouldn't hear him.
You don't care, do you?'</p>

<p>"I have almost told a fib, and said, 'no indeed.'</p>

<p>Two days later.</p>

<p>"I have had my revenge on the captain by
jumping overboard.</p>

<p>"Yesterday Flora and myself were lounging
upon the stationary seat, attached to the
railing of the hurricane deck. Both of us had
been silent for some time. I had been gazing
dreamily down into the deep, blue waters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
thinking of, I hardly know what, but, I remember
that a strange impulse occasionally
seized me to plunge beneath those snow-capped
waves and rest my poor head upon the
ocean's bed, for it is not as easy to hold it up
now as it once was, when mammy lived, and
took me in her arms and bade the 'Honey
hold up her blessed little head, and never let
that droop whatever might come.' Precious
old creature, she too bore a life long sorrow,
and bravely bore it. Daddy never suspected,
that his bustling, little grey wife had a tender
secret burried beneath the tumult of activity,
which continually bubbled up within her generous
breast.</p>

<p>"But I am digressing from the subject of
my sea bath, of which Miss Flora was the
immediate occasion. She had incautiously
leaned too far over the railing, and, losing
her balance, fell. I was startled from my
reverie by a slight scream, and in an instant
more, she was beneath the waves. I knew
that I could swim, and had I not, I would
have plunged after her all the same.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>

<p>"I discovered, however, that the waves in
a quiet cove of the Mississippi, were but ripples
compared with the surging waters of the
ocean, and my childhood paddle in the former
but a poor preparation for battle. I sank
deep and rose breathless, and almost helpless,
but fortunately, Flora was dashed within my
reach, and I clutched her dress, and we were
both saved.</p>

<p>"The captain had witnessed the accident
from the deck and was the first to come to
our rescue. Spars were thrown out, and
several hardy sailors leaped in and helped to
bear us up until the life boat was lowered,
and we were all once more transported on
board of our staunch ship.</p>

<p>"I have been flattered and feted ever
since. A grand supper was given in my
honor last evening, and, as I was in such high
favor, I made bold to accept my invitation on
condition that the table should be innocent
of wine. The Captain cordially complied
with the condition, although Flora had previously
volunteered the information, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
'papa was wery fond of wine, but mamma
did not like him to drink it.'</p>

<p>"The dear child has much to say about her
mama, who, 'died, a wery, wery long time
ago.' One little year has she been motherless,
and what sweet graphic pictures does she
draw of the lost one. 'Mama had wery soft
curls, papa called 'em golden; mama had
wery blue eyes, papa called 'em wiolet, and
she had wery pink cheeks, and papa called
'em sea shells, and he called her wery little
mouth, a rose bud and her wery soft hands,
welvet, and what do you think he named her
wery, wery, cunning little feets?&mdash;mices.&mdash;He
read all about 'em in a book one evening,
how they stoled in and out like little mices,&mdash;now
wasn't that wery, wery nice?'</p>

<p>"She is more devoted to me than ever,
since her narrow escape from the sea, and she
is sure that I will not be sent into the cabin
when the next storm comes on. Indeed I exacted
a promise from the Captain, while at
the feast to that effect. He said I might be
lashed to the rigging and blown to pieces if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
I wished, and I do wish&mdash;O how I long for
another storm,"</p>

<p>Three days later.</p>

<p>"The sky is clear, the sea smooth, and the
passengers are mostly upon deck, enjoying
the fine weather.</p>

<p>"Mr. and Miss Marsden have appeared for
the first time, and we have had a general rejoicing.
The Captain is an old friend of
theirs and we were invited into his room and
treated to wine on the occasion. All drank
socially except myself and Flora, who, when
she saw that I had taken none, set her glass
down untasted.</p>

<p>'The influence of good example,' said the
Captain smiling approvingly on Flora.</p>

<p>"Do you really think the example good?"
I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"'Most certainly, my dear Miss DeWolf,
my wife would have acted precisely the same.
She did not approve social drinking, but one
in my position acquires the habit almost from
necessity. My associations are mostly with a
class that expect it of me. I do not care for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
it myself, but I do not like to appear unsocial.'</p>

<p>"'Nor do I,' chimed in Miss Marsden, sipping
her glass.</p>

<p>"'We tempt and are tempted on every
hand,' said Mr. Marsden thoughtfully. 'Society
demands the social glass and we yield
to its demands, and why? Because we have
not the moral courage to do otherwise.'</p>

<p>"We have! I exclaimed, we have! you
have, your sister has, the Captain has. You
have never tried. You have never fully
realized whither it tended&mdash;I have. Shall I
tell you?</p>

<p>"At any ordinary time I would not have
drawn the heart rending picture of the consequences
of social drinking which I was then
inspired to do. It was as if a frightful panorama
of ruined fortunes, and ruined families
was passing before me and I described all I
saw and when the view became too painful,
too revolting for words, I bowed my head and
wept.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span></p>

<p>"'For heavens sake, say no more,' cried out
the Captain.</p>

<p>"Flora flung her arms around my neck,
and mingled her tears with mine. 'What
shall we do?' she asked plaintively.</p>

<p>"'We might draw up a total abstinence
pledge and all put our names to it,' said Sir.
Marsden quite cheerfully.</p>

<p>"After some pleasent discussion, his suggestion
obtained favor, and was carried out
without delay, and in half an hour's time we
were all pledged to total abstinence from intoxicating
drinks. The matter was duly explained
to Flora, and she added her mark
with an air of consequence quite amusing.</p>

<p>"Nor was that all; the enthusiastic little
missionary stated that she knew of several
wery nice sailors who would like to put their
names on the paper, for she had seen them
drink something out of bottles. She was accordingly
permitted to present this pledge to
her particular friends, who, it transpired, included
the whole crew.</p>

<p>"I was much affected by a little scene<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
which I witnessed in connection with her labors.
A weather-beaten old sailor, whose only
fault was his uncontrollable appetite for
rum, read the pledge carefully, and, shaking
his head quite hopelessly, handed it back. 'I
can't agree to that, little pet,' said he, 'I
can't abstain, I'd give the world if I could,
but I can't. I lay in bed the morning we set
sail and thought it all over. I thought of
my little boy and gal sleeping in their trundle
bed. I thought of the pleadings of my patient
wife, and I resolved to let liquor alone, but
I can't do it&mdash;I was the worse for it yesterday.
No, I can't abstain,' and his voice
quivered.</p>

<p>"'May be, if you'd try again, wery, wery
hard,' persisted Flora, who did not comprehend
how uncontrollable the appetite becomes.</p>

<p>"'No, my little pet&mdash;no&mdash;none but God
Almighty can save me now&mdash;I'm in the
breakers.'</p>

<p>"His look of despair moved me to step forward
and interpose. Would not Flora have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
perished in the deep water, had there been
no effort made to save her? I questioned.</p>

<p>"'You're a brave gal,' said he. 'I saw
you go after her; you would have saved her
if you could, and you would save me but you
can't.'</p>

<p>"That's true, I replied, but God can.
Jesus Christ will bring you safely out of the
breakers, if you will cling to him. You are
in great peril but it is not too late. Never
give up the ship.</p>

<p>"Thus I talked until hope began to reanimate
him, and he said 'when I get back to
New York I'll try again to give up my dram
and be a Christian.'</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;now, there's no time like now, I
persisted, and finally he yielded, and said,
'Now it shall be. I'll put my name to the
paper, and may God Almighty help me.'</p>

<p>"His name, John Hopkins, stands in full
upon the pledge; the large crooked letters
bearing traces of the struggle by which he
was shaken.</p>

<p>"I am so glad that I ever read the Bible to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
dear old Mrs. Peters, for it was there that I
learned the lesson, which I so lately taught
the despairing seamen, and nothing can now
wrest the sweet knowledge of a Saviour's
love from me. My heart has found refuge in
it.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the day that Tom
dressed in your blue apron, with a bunch of
keys at his belt and pretended to personate me
at the head of an orphan asylum, how we all
laughed? Well, I secretly wished myself capable
of doing good in that way, and you
may tell Tom that if I should ever attempt
anything of the kind, I will give him a lucrative
situation as general overseer of the establishment."</p>

<p>Two days later.</p>

<p>"Last evening we arrived at Aspinwall
having made the trip from New York in ten
days. This morning we bade adieu to our
kind friends of the steamship, 'Northern
Star' and crossed the Isthmus of Panama, a
distance of about twenty miles, by railroad.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
A fine large steamer lay upon the waters of
the Pacific awaiting our arrival.</p>

<p>"Having embarked, I found a little vacant
nook, under the awning, where I am now
writing, while the scenes of to-day are still
fresh in my mind.</p>

<p>"I was enchanted as we passed swiftly over
the narrow neck of land dividing the two
oceans. The dense, vine-clad forests, alive
with birds of every brilliant hue, and bordered
with gorgeous flowers; the low thatched
huts of the natives, and the natives themselves
in holiday dress of thin white, all conspired
to awaken the most pleasing emotions.</p>

<p>"The villages at both ends of the route
were swarming with natives, the women with
baskets of cake and fruit and beautiful birds
for sale, the men eager to carry our luggage
for 'two bits.'</p>

<p>"A small proportion of the women were
bright and pretty; one really beautiful, with
liquid eyes and smooth jet braids, upon which
were fantastically perched a pair of green,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
trained birds, was very popular with the passengers,
and soon emptied her basket.</p>

<p>"I purchased her pet paroquets and sent
them to console Flora, whom I left sobbing
quite piteously in the Captain's arms. We
promised her papa to make our arrangements
to return on his steamer and his promise to
lash me to the rigging in the event of a storm
still holds good."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 65px;">
<img src="images/capB.jpg" width="65" height="90" alt="B" title="B" />
</div><p class="dropcap">efore opening another letter, let us
pay a flying visit to the Sherman family,
and also to Daddy and his spouse.</p>

<p>The former are to be found in their old
quarters at Pendleton, the latter installed in
the brown house at Chimney Rock.</p>

<p>It is near midnight, rather an unseasonable
hour to intrude upon our friends, but no matter;
at the house we shall first enter; regular
habits do not prevail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span></p>

<p>We will now imagine ourselves in the
broad hall, on the second floor of the finest
hotel in Pendleton.</p>

<p>Open softly the door at your right. There
the eldest Mrs. Sherman lies sleeping. Her
grey hair is parted smoothly under her white
frilled cap, her hands are folded resignedly
upon her breast, and the angel of her dreams
has imprinted upon her features the chastened
smile so often seen upon the face of age.</p>

<p>We would fain prolong her slumbers, for,
alas, we cannot stay the swiftly drifting cloud,
that is coming to darken her waking hours:
the silver lining of which she will not see,
until, a spirit winged for glory, she soars
above it.</p>

<p>A confusion of sounds from below reaches
us. Footsteps are upon the stairs, uncertain,
shuffling, as if grouping in darkness. Low,
persuasive voices are heard, a sharp retort
follows. "No, Clara is fiendish when I have
been drinking, I will not meet her."</p>

<p>A woman has just brushed past us. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
stands at the head of the stairs, pale and determined.</p>

<p>"Bring him not here," she hisses between
her closed teeth, to the men who are assisting
her husband to mount. "Take him to your
own homes&mdash;listen to his ravings. Bear his
insults; blows if need be. Perform the most
disagreeable services for him. Yes, even imperil
your lives in his service, you who are
his disinterested friends. You, who have enjoyed
your bacchanalian revels with him,
take the consequences. Bring him not to
me. I despise, I hate the man who cannot
control his appetite&mdash;I tell you away with
him!" she shrieked, as his friends continued
to urge him upward.</p>

<p>"Clara." A hand is laid gently on her
arm. Her mother-in-law stands trembling
beside her; the noise has awakened her, and
she has come out in her night dress. "I will
take Edward to my room and quiet him; he
shall not disturb you, my daughter."</p>

<p>"I am not your daughter. I will no longer
be his wife. I will leave the house this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
moment never to return. He has disgraced
me long enough. I will not bear it. I will
not be the wife of a drunkard. I have told
him so times without number. You may
soothe him if you like&mdash;pet him&mdash;give him
peppermint&mdash;I will not live with a man who
cannot control his appetite."</p>

<p>Tears and entreaties, are of no avail; the
determination of the high-spirited wife remains
unaltered, and she has gone forth to
her father's house, leaving her mother-in-law
not quite alone with the invalid, for Louise
and the doctor have been summoned.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, how thrives Daddy?</p>

<p>We shall see by the morning sun. It has
just risen, and so has Daddy. He peeps out
and the sun peeps in, blinding his old eyes
and cheering his old heart. He and Recta
are happy now. Hear him whistle like a boy
as he dresses. Recta helps him put his rheumatic
arm into his coat sleeve, and he kisses
Recta.</p>

<p>Both leave the room, and as they pass a
door standing ajar, push it open; Here is lit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>tle
Fanny Green standing with bare feet before
the open window, brushing out her flaxen
hair.</p>

<p>"O, Daddy," she exclaims, "a bird flew in
here awhile ago, a real live bird flew right in
at the window, and throbbed his wings so
hard against the glass that he woke me.
Why, before I could catch him, he flew out.
Do you think it would have been wicked to
have caught him, Daddy?"</p>

<p>"Laws, no, Fanny. 'Tween you and me,
the Honey would have ketched him in a second.
She was uncommon spry when she was
a leetle gal."</p>

<p>"O, Daddy, may&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You musn't hinder me now; I must go
fur tu milk the cows."</p>

<p>"O, well, you won't feed the chickens 'till
I come, will you, Daddy? I'll dress, O, ever
so quick, and say a very little prayer, and
come right out. I want to feed the speckled
hen and the little yellow chicks; please Daddy
don't forget me, will you?"</p>

<p>Recta looks very much disturbed as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
pass on together. "That bird," she mutters
very mysteriously, "it's a very bad sign."</p>

<p>"What's a bad sign, Recta?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know, Phillip, when a
bird comes into the house it's a sure sign of
death in the family? I have never known it
to fail. There was Squire Billings died in
less than a year after a bird flew in at the
winder. Sally told me they was a watching
for some one to die and it turned out to be
the Squire."</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, Recta, that was
singular; now I think on't I've noticed lately
that Fanny has looked ruther pimpin. We
must not cross her in nuthin. I shan't tech
the chicken feed 'til she comes; 'tween you
and me, hadn't we better write to the Honey?"</p>

<p>"May be she don't believe in signs, some
don't," said Recta, reflectively.</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, we might tell her
about Squire Billings."</p>

<p>"That wouldn't make any difference, Phillip,
you can't convince some people. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
may as well not write until Fanny is really
taken sick. I wonder if she had ever had the
measles: Neighbor Wycoff is awful sick with
them."</p>

<p>"'Tween you and me, I guess we had better
write," persists Daddy, struck with a new
terror.</p>

<p>There is a sudden hush, and Fanny trips
in bright as a May morning.</p>

<p>"I am requested to give my testimony

the parlor. Miss Fanny had learned
to knit, and had constructed a pair of stockings.
Mrs. Recta says if she <i>lives</i> she will
make a good housekeeper. I shall marry her
when she is old enough. The old folks are
sure she will die 'afore the year is out, 'cause
a bird flew in at her winder.' I told them
the bird was after Daddy, and the superstitious
old man was instantly seized with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
violent pain in his big toe. I am afraid he
will feel it is his duty to die. He and Recta
bill and coo like two old fools.</p>

<p>I am ready to swear to the above testimony.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Tom.</span>"</p>

<p>"I am afraid, my dear, that Tom's nonsense
has illy prepared your mind for the sad
news I have to communicate concerning your
friends the Shermans. The elder and the
younger Mrs. Sherman are both dead. The
elder died last week; it is said of a broken
heart. The other accidently put an end to
her own life several weeks ago. She had
parted from her husband, he having returned
home several times intoxicated. Being in a
very unhappy frame of mind in her father's
house, she resorted to morphine to induce
sleep, and, unaccustomed to its effects, swallowed
an over dose. The mistake was discovered
when too late to save her. It is said
that Edward's remorse is fearful, and he has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
solemly sworn never to taste another drop of
intoxicating drink. His home is now with
Dr. Goodrich and his sister, who have commenced
house-keeping in a nice little cottage."</p></div>

<p>Extract from Little Wolf's reply.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Many thanks to Tom for his share of the
letter. I hope he will frequently repeat his
visits to Chimney Rock, and acquaint me
with the results. It will discipline him for
the work I shall assign him in my orphan
asylum, and moreover I feel concerned about
the pain in Daddy's big toe.</p>

<p>"All jesting aside, so many unforseen events
have crowded into the months of my absense
that I feel prepared for almost any change.
It is well that I know that you will be a
mother to Fanny in the event of any change
in Daddy's family. According to Tom's account,
he is to be her husband. I will draw
a picture of their courtship for him.</p>

<p>"A slender, fair haired girl and a gallant
youth seated&mdash;let me think&mdash;<i>three feet
apart</i> in the grape arbor at the old brown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
house. Their eyes meet and speak a language
quite familiar to gallant youths and
fair haired girls in general, and to those two
in particular. How prettily the white throat
of the beautiful blonde swells, and how the
frill of lace around it trembles, as if fanned
by the passing breeze.</p>

<p>"They do not see the white haired old
man who is silently gathering grapes without
the arbor, occasionally peering cautiously
through the vines and lattice work at them.</p>

<p>"He is a loquacious old fellow, (that Daddy)
and he will doubtless complete the picture
for us by and by.</p>

<p>"Mr. Marsden's fever has left him broken
in health and spirits. His lungs have never
been strong, having been subject to occasional
hemorrhages. He complains of constant
pain in his chest, and I fear it will be a long
time before he recovers. His physician
thinks it will not be safe for him to return
home this fall, and we shall probably spend
the winter in this mild climate.</p>

<p>"We have formed quite a pleasant circle of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
acquaintances, and our evenings are musical,
conversational or <i>gamical</i>, as best suits the
invalid, who lies upon the sofa and dictates
the programme. Last evening we did nothing
but talk. An editor of one of our city
journals was present, having just returned
from an extensive tour through the wine
growing districts of the State. He says that
wine making is fraught with dire evils to the
producer and to the country. That it has
become almost as cheap as milk, and as freely
drank, till many once sober men are now
habitually intoxicated. He was told that in
one neighborhood, young girls seventeen
years of age, reeled in the streets under the
intoxication of pure California wine. Men
whom he once knew to be of worth he found
lost to society, and becoming a fear and disgrace
to their families. One leading man
whom he met, enumerated five of his acquaintances,
who, once noble men, are now
to be called drunkards through wine. He
thinks that the production of the article, now
fearfully on the increase, must become a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
curse to the whole land if persevered in.</p>

<p>"In going through the wine growing regions
he found it expected, as an act of politeness,
that wine must everywhere be presented
and drank, and if he consented at all
to drink, he would be compelled to drink
many times a day, and would become a wine
toper with others. He declared that touch
not, taste not, handle not the accursed thing,
was the only rule of safety.</p>

<p>"He said if each grape grower would grow
only the raisin grape for sale, there would be
no end to the profitable disposal of all which
he could ever produce without sin or danger
to any one.</p>

<p>"I remarked that European travellers told
us that very few drank to intoxication in
those places where wine was made from the
pure juice of the grape, and it was generally
supposed that the manufacture of pure domestic
wine in this country would do away
almost entirety with intemperance.</p>

<p>"In answer, he read us a letter which he
had just received from his friend, a well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
known resident of this city now in France.
It contained a flat contradiction of the statements
to which I had alluded, and drew a
dark picture of the intemperance in the wine
producing districts of France and Germany.
In fact, it was a radical plea&mdash;as Daddy
would say&mdash;'agin the hull infarnel stuff.'"</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>

<div class="chaphead"><p><b>Another Death in the Old Brown
House.</b></p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/capI.jpg" width="100" height="160" alt="I" title="I" />
</div><p class="dropcap">t was late in the month of December
when Little Wolf received from Mrs.
Tinknor the following sad account of
the Death Angel's visit to the old brown
house:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"My dear child:</p>

<p>What I am about to write
will give you great pain, for I know how
dearly you loved poor old Daddy, and how
it will grieve you to hear that you will never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
see him again in this world. He died on the
morning of the fifteenth, after a short illness
of ten days.</p>

<p>"Tom had been down on a visit and returned
saying that Daddy was complaining of
rheumatic pains, and he was much worse the
day he left, and his wife was much concerned
about him. As Tom urged it, I went
down hoping to cheer up the old couple.</p>

<p>"When I arrived I found Daddy confined
to his bed, and groaning with pain, while his
wife and Fanny and several of the neighbors,
were flying about, applying hot fomentations,
and a variety of liniments. (It is astonishing
how many busy feet one sick man can
keep in motion.)</p>

<p>"I immediately sent for Dr. Goodrich, although
Daddy's wife mentioned to me in confidence,
that a 'parcel of old women were
worth a dozen doctors who killed more than
they cured; and Daddy himself managed to
gasp out, ''Tween you an' me, Miss Tinknor
a leetle good nussin is the most I need.
Doctors can't cure rheumatiz.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span></p>

<p>"However, he looked forward very anxiously
to the Doctor's arrival. When he did
come and prescribed the free use of brandy,
all of Daddy's prejudices were at once aroused,
and no persuasions could induce him to
use 'the devil's pison outside or in.'</p>

<p>"I believe had he been stretched upon the
rack he would have died rather than yield
the point; for to the last, he adhered firmly
to his total abstinence principles, and at the
eleventh hour he entered his master's vineyard.</p>

<p>"It was beautiful indeed to witness the
ministrations of little Fanny. From the first
of his illness she wept over and prayed for
him, and taught him, who had gone all his
life long a hungry prodigal, the way to his
Father's house. I never shall forget those
lessons, which so sweetly fell from her childish
lips and the joy that beamed in her speaking
face, when Daddy at length appeared to
have a clear understanding of her teachings.</p>

<p>"''Tween you and me, Fanny, you've
pinted straight this time,' said he one day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
after having listened a while to her conversation.
'It's all plain now&mdash;I see my Father,
I see my elder brother, the Lord Jusus interceding
for me&mdash;I see the table spread, and
I ain't had no hand in the spreadin of it.
He'll hev to reach down and take me jest as
I am, and he'll du it&mdash;I'm sartin of it, cause
Fanny, you know it is said <i>whosoever</i>. That
are <i>whosoever</i> is the <i>comprehendest</i> word in
the hull Bible. Miss Peters pinted it out to
the Honey, and the Honey told me about it
jest afore I started fur Recta, and some how
it went into one ear and out 'tother. Howsoever,
I could see the Honey was a heap
changed by it, though it don't take away nun
of her pretty.&mdash;She was more tenderer like,
and when she spoke tu me about it, the tears
cum into her bright eyes, jest like the pearls
sot around the diamonds in her ring. I'm
kinder thinkin we shall talk that are matter
over when she comes back.'</p>

<p>"Up to the last day he was hopeful of getting
well, and none of us felt specially concerned
about him. The doctor came and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
went with words of cheer, and I was making
preparations to go home, when the unexpected
summons came. His pain seemed suddenly
to change to the region of his heart,
and I heard him say to Fanny, ''Tween you
an me, Fanny, the pain is in my heart. I
believe I'm called fur, and I ain't done no
good in the world yet. My temperance lectur
didn't amount to nothin. I'm glad I
never delivered it, fur it ain't got none of
Jesus's love in it, and men du need the Almighty's
lovin hand in that are thing. Fur
it's the devil's pison and mighty hard to fight
agin. Wouldn't the Honey be glad though,
if she knew what a fine man that are Sherman
is since he give up drinkin. Tell her
that poor old Daddy blessed her with his dyin
breath. Call Recta, Fanny.'</p>

<p>"I sprang to his bedside, and in a moment
Recta was there also. The dying man took
my hand and thanked me for all my attentions
to him, and then his eyes rested tenderly
upon his wife. He tried to speak, but a
spasm of pain checked him, and Recta bent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
low to catch the words. He pointed upwards,
threw his arms around her neck, and
was gone.</p>

<p>"We buried him at the left of your parents
beside mammy, and when I left a mantle of
soft, white snow was flung over all.</p>

<p>"I brought Fanny home with me, and
Recta is living with Dr. Goodrich's family.
Having previously been so many years their
servant, she is much attached to the doctor's
wife and Edward Sherman.</p>

<p>"Edward Sherman was very attentive to
Daddy during his illness, frequently riding
down with the doctor and remaining until
his next morning's visit. There is certainly
a striking change in his appearance. I honor
him for the straight-forward, high-minded
course he has of late taken. Having learned
his weakness before it was too late, it has become
to him an element of strength, and his
influence over his associates speaks well for
his future usefulness.</p>

<p>"We all long to see you again, Fanny in
particular wishes for your return every day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
although she seems quite content with us,
and is a great favorite with Tom, who amuses
himself by plying her with difficult questions,
which she patiently puzzles her ingenious little
brain to answer.</p>

<p>P.S. I obtained permission of Recta to
send you Daddy's temperance lecture, with
the request that you carefully preserve and
return it to her."</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>

<div class="chaphead"><p><b>Daddy's Temperance Lecture.</b></p></div>

</div><p class="dropcap">aving slightly modified the spelling
in Daddy's lecture, in order to make it
the more easily read, and at the same
time to render it in his own diction, we now
place it, with the preliminary arrangments,
"fur tu be read silent," before the reader.</p>

<p>"Fust, haul out my specks.</p>

<p>Second, haul out my yeller silk hankercher.</p>

<p>Third, wipe them air specks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span></p>

<p>Fourth, put them air specks on my nose.</p>

<p>Fifth, put that air yeller silk handkercher
in my pocket.</p>

<p>Sixth, clar my throat.</p>

<p>Seventh, go at it loud.</p>

<p>I don't expect fur to say nothin new on the
subject of temperance, but it wont du fur tu
say nothin cause you can't get up no new
ideas. Now supposen a neat housekeeper
shouldn't hev nothin fur to say, tu a parcel
of careless heedless boys and gals, cause she
must say the same old thing over every day.
Hezekiah clean yer feet. Matilda, hang up
yer shawl. Susan Maria put away yer gloves,
what kind of a house du ye think that air
would be, all topsy turvey and kivered with
dirt? If them air children don't mind at
fust, she keeps up that air kind of talk from
one year's end tu 'tother, and ginerally speaking
they grow up tu be orderly men and women.</p>

<p>Just so we've got to hammer and ding
away at the temperance cause from genera<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>tion
to generation, if we want our children tu
be nice temperate men. Never mind gitten
up no new ideas: tech not, taste not, handle
not, is good enough for any age. Then agin,
ken ye expect yer boys fur tu be tidy when
yer own feet are dirty and yer things out of
place over the hull house? Them are little
shavers think it's big tu du what daddy does
and they are pretty nigh sartin fur to drink
that air nasty lager beer if daddy does. Hev
a mat at yer door and keep yer own feet
clean, and hev Hezekiah and Matilda and
Susan Maria put theirn there, tu. That's
the way fur tu du.</p>

<p>Some say, a little wine won't hurt a pussen;
some say, lager beer won't hurt a pussen;
some say, cider won't hurt nobody: but
I say, the infarnel stuff which makes men
drunk, no matter what name it goes by, is
the stuff fur to let alone. It's the infarnel
stuff, that makes holes in yer wallets and
holes in yer breeches, and holes in yer winders,
and holes in yer wife's heart, and kivers
yer children all over with holes; and last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
of all opens a big hole in the ground fur ye
tu slide through inter the infarnel regions.</p>

<p>I hev had it thrown inter my face that Jesus
Christ hisself, made wine out of water,
fur weddins, and the govenor of the feast said
it was the best they hed hed. I ain't no
doubt of it nuther, jest fur two reasons, fust,
it was made of water, second, Jesus Christ
hisself made it, and ye may bet all yer new
clothes, <i>He</i> wouldn't hev done nothin to hurt
nobody, I wouldn't have been afeared myself,
fur tu drink wine made of water, by Jesus
Christ. I reckon we don't get no such now
days. Like enough, one reason for his makin
it was fur tu hender 'em from gittin any
more of the miserable intoxicating stuff. One
thing is sartin, if he was God, he wouldn't
dispute hisself, and the Bible expressly says,
'Look not upon the wine&mdash;fur in the end it
biteth like a sarpent and stingeth like an adder.'</p>

<p>I don't profess fur tu know much about
scriptur, but a nice leetle gal pinted that air
varse out to me, and she pinted out another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
which said, 'No drunkard ken enter the
kingdom of heaven.' Howsoever, I ain't no
preacher, and like enough tham air black
coats hev got up some big idee that clars up
the hull subject. My religion is tu do the
best we kin, and we needn't be shaky about
the futur. I've been a advocating that air
doctrine this sixty years and folks ginerally
sarve me as two leetle boys did not long ago.
They was a making a puny leetle dog draw a
heavy loaded sled, and I said to them are leetle
shavers, 'you'd better turn in and push
the sled and help that air tired weakly dog
of yourn;' and when I looked back a few
minutes after, them air leetle rascals was
both riding on top of the load, and had their
fingers at their noses a pintin at me.</p>

<p>What people want is fur to have their
hearts teched deep, and I don't know how
fur tu du it. I could tell stories about what
liquor has done, that orter set every one of
ye a snivellin powerful, but I reckon you'd
ruther hear something funny. Temperance
lecturers is generally expected fur tu tell fun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>ny
stories jest as a farmer is expected fur tu
feed out his husks tu them air animals that
loves fur tu chaw husks. The grain goes
futher when he fodders in that air way.</p>

<p>But I don't know nothin funny connected
with the subject of drinking. It is all kivered
over with groans and sighs and tears and
blood, and ye'd shudder fur tu hear about it,
and yer feelins may be would get tu tossin
and bilin like mad, but yer wouldn't <i>du</i> nothin.
My be in a few minutes you'd treat me
as them air boys did, and take a glass of beer
with yer neighbors, cause all that biling and
tossin is on the surface. It don't go deep
enough fur tu make ye act.</p>

<p>T'other night a neighbor of mine was a
walkin hum with me and we went past the
house of an old Scothman, who gits drunk
every time he ken git trusted, or treated or
ken git change enough fur tu buy the whiskey,
and his wife ain't no better than he is.
They hev two nice leetle children, a boy and
a gal, and them air unfeeling wretches, hed,
in a fit of drunken madness, actually shet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
their leetle boy and gal out of doors that cold
freezing night. The poor babies was half
naked, and they had curled powerful close
together on the door step, where the winds
blowed around and gnawed away at their
half froze bodies, until the stout hearted boy
cried with pain as he tuck off his Scotch bonnet
and put his sister's poor, little, red, frostbit
feet inter it. His own feet was bare, and
their heads was bare, and in a little while
they might hev froze to death, hed we not
passed that air way. Wall, we stopped and
tried fur tu make them air critters inside
open the door, but they hed locked up, and
settled down inter a drunken sleep, and the
children begged us not fur tu disturb 'em for
them are children was afeared of being mauled
tu death. They'd ruther freeze than ventur
in. So one of 'em I tuck and my neighbor
tuck t'other hum. He was a swearing
away all the time at them air folks making
such beasts of themselves.</p>

<p>Now, what du yer think he did hisself the
next day? He got so tight he couldn't walk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
straight. I met him a going hum smellin like
a whiskey barrel and raising his feet powerful
high. Says I, 'Neighbor G., I wouldn't hev
thought you would ever hev teched another
mite of liquor after what we see last night.'
Says he, 'Mr. Roarer, I ken control my appetite.
I know jest when fur tu stop. I
shall go hum and kiss my wife and children
and not drive 'em out of doors as Scotch
Billy did.'</p>

<p>Says I, 'Thats just the way Scotch Billy
talked five years ago.' 'Wall, wall,' says he,
'I ain't one of yer Scotch Billys; I know
when fur tu stop.'</p>

<p>But ye won't du it; ye'll cave under by
and by. Them air kind that brag that they
know jest when fur tu stop is generally the
very ones that go under afore they know it,
I thinked tu myself as he staggered off.</p>

<p>If there is an old toper present, or a young
toper, let 'em take the warning of an old
man who has been awatching the gradual
down fall of moderate drinkers for threescore
years. I've seen 'em live, and I've seen 'em<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
die. <i>Die</i> ain't no name fur the last struggle
I've seen 'em go through with. Jest picture
tu yourself a grapery, stretchin miles away,
and in that air grapery is walkin men of
every age and condition, and all are a pluckin
them are big purple grapes. Some eat
many, some, few; some grow red and portly,
some grow pale and thin, (them air pale ones
take the longest strides and get to the end
fust.) They hev all been warned that that
air fruit hes been pisened, and some of them
git a leetle frightened at seein the strange
way it effects companions, and they turn
back, but the most on 'em go on, plucking
and eating, heedless of the cries of them
without. O, they know jest how many fur tu
eat and not die. Their friends needn't worry:
they ken take care of theirselves.</p>

<p>'Mother,' says a youth, lookin through the
lattices, with a glow upon his cheek, 'I'm all
right, don't bother about me. See Mr. Moderate
Drinker ahead there,&mdash;see how hale
he looks&mdash;he'll live longer than any of ye
outside.' But afore long that air smart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
youth goes reeling past Mr. Moderate Drinker,
toward the end.&mdash;It is too late now&mdash;let
his mother cry to heaven and wring her
hands and lie in the ashes upon the hearth.
It is all in vain.&mdash;'My boy, oh, my boy!'
rings unheeded in his ear. A mother's voice,
a mother's tears, a mother's anguish, what
are they compared with the fruit, which he
has lost the power to resist, and which his
companions are constantly urging upon him?
But look! He suddenly starts back pale and
fearful. He has seen the precipice and the
black gulfs with open jaws jest afore him?
No, ah no, the heavy clusters and the interlaced
vines hide that. But he heard the despairing
shriek of a feller traveller as he
plunged in; and for a moment he tremblingly
questions, what is there?</p>

<p>Ah, there is no clusters, no leaves, no
vines, between that spot and his devoted
mother's eye. She has long looked fearfully
towards it, and, just upon the verge, she sees
him falter.</p>

<p>A faint hope springs up within her, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
with the courage of desperation, she cries out
in a voice that might pierce the skies, 'Turn,
oh, my boy, turn, flee fur yer life&mdash;one step
forward and ye are lost!' Her last words
are drowned in the jeers of his companions,
and his senses are deadened by the odors of
the purple cluster just ahead, and to reach it
he takes the fatal step. Fur a moment he
hangs suspended over the abyss, clutchin the
vines whose roots take hold on hell, and as
with bloodshot eyes and fearful shrieks, he
tugs and strains to regain his footin, a foul
sarpent winds its way among the leaves, and
stealthily strikes his fangs inter the branch
to which he clings, and gnaws his last refuge.</p>

<p>That air is the way they die.</p>

<p>Now, can't nothin be done fur to keep
folks out of that air grapery? If the law
would only put a door tu it, and shet it tight,
I recken there wouldn't be many that would
git in thar. Some old topers that hev got a
strong hankerin after that pisen fruit, might
crawl through the lattices to get it. When
the place is wide open and everything looks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
temptin, and they see a crowd a going that
air way, it is easy fur tu foller, but when it's
all shet up they turn away tu somethin better,
fur almost any thin is better than sech a
place as I hev described.</p>

<p>I know that a passel of big lawyers and
judges say that we can't make a effectual
door cause there ain't no timber in the constitution
fur tu make it of and so some is fur
putting up a rickety kind of a barricade fur
tu keep folks on Sundays and lection days,
and some is fur hevin a gate that them air
sarpents inside will hev fur tu pay a big pile
of money fur tu get the privilege of openin.
But I don't see why on airth, if they ken git
timber fur them air half way consarns, they
can't git it fur a hull door. If they can't,
they hed better graft, some law agin liquor
sellin branches inter that air constitutional
tree, and hev them air infarnel roads to the
infarnel regions blocked up entirely.</p>

<p>Howsoever, while its open a single crack
we must du the best we ken fur tu keep the
people out of the wrong track. Them air<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
temperance societies, and temperance pledges
is mighty good, but there ain't enough of 'em
and they ain't active enough. Now, a nice,
smart, rosy-cheeked gal instead of passin
round wine tu her little party of friends,
might pass a temperance pledge, and coax
them air beaux of hern inter puttin their
names tu it, and give 'em a nice cup of coffee
fur tu top off with. There might be lots of
them air kind of things did, if folks only set
themselves to work in earnest. Instead of
telling yer friends that it won't hurt'em, as
I've heerd of some infatuated pussons doin,
tell 'em total abstinence won't hurt 'em, and
I'll ventur fur tu say they'll thank ye fur it,
instead of cussin of ye tu all eternity fur puttin
the glass to their lips. That air reminds
me of another scriptur that that air little gal
pinted out to me, 'Woe tu him that putteth
the glass to his neighbor's lips.' That air is
all the scriptur I ken quote correct 'tween
Genesis and Revelation. I larned it fur tu
throw in the face of one of them black coats,
that hes invited me fur tu tend his church.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
Sez I tu him, 'If ye'll preach from that air
text I'll go.' Sez he, 'I preach the gospel.
I can't be givin my valooble time to politics
and temperance lecturs, but I'll read that air
chapter to my congregation if ye'll come.'
Sez I, 'no-siree! I don't believe in no half
way business.' Ye see I had an inkling that
he was afeered of that air rich hullsale liquor
dealer that tended his church. Them that
retail the stuff is generally looked down upon,
but them air that is rich enough to shovel
it out by the hullsale is looked up tu on the
principle, turn yer back tu a poor devil, take
off yer hat to a rich devil.</p>

<p>I never could think of anythin bad enough
fur tu say about the mischief them air liquor
dealers du, and rather guess on that account
I'll hev fur tu leave 'em to the cuss which
God Almighty hisself has passed upon 'em.
I hev no doubt but that air cuss has been
echoed and rechoed by millions upon millions
of their victims. I would hate to have all
the cusses of the widows and orphans, and
the wus than widows and orphans that them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
air ginerations of vipers hev made, and bit.</p>

<p>But there is another pint which consarns
every one of us. Hev we a right to stand by
silent and see these things did?</p>

<p>That air is a big question that some folks
would like fur to dodge, cause maybe if they
took a active part agin drunkard makin, it
might interfere with their dollars, or with
their friends or with their interests in other
ways. But ye can't dodge the question; its
afore ye, and there it shall stand until Gabriel
blows his big horn, and you'll hev fur tu answer
it, tu the Almighty, hisself.</p>

<p>Don't the Bible say that every tub shall
stand on its own bottom? I've heerd it did,
and I'm a thinkin that all of them air useless
tubs that stand out a sunning theirselves, will
fall down and not hev any bottom fur tu
stand on when they are fur, and will only be
fit fur firewood. Fur my part I don't blame
God Almighty fur pitchin folks inter the infarnel
regions when they won't du nothin fur
tu keep things right in this ere world, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
some actually hender others from doing anything.</p>

<p>Now, supposen there was a big hole in the
end of our street and a passel of citizens
should du all they could to keep that air hole
open fur people to fall inter, and you'd hear
'em hollerin out tu folks that was a tryin to
stop it up; 'Let that air hole alone, everybody
knows its there, if they don't want fur
tu git inter it let em go another way; there
is plenty of streets;' wouldn't yer think them
air rascals ought to be singed to all etarnity?
Well, what's the mighty difference 'tween
them air, and a passel of citizens that'll set
by and see their feller citizens go straight inter
that air hole and say nothin? I believe
in men's minding their own business, and I
hold its a man's business to save a drownding
feller critter if he ken.</p>

<p>I hev now come to my last pint. It is this.
Shall we hev laws that will save our nation
from becoming a nation of drunkards, or
shall we not? Just picture to yourself a
drunken president. We hev hed him. Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
picture a passel of drunken senators. We
hev hed them, tu. Seems zif the more big
men ken circulate the devil's pisen, the better
they like it, and that air in my opinion is
one reason why we can't get laws tu shet
down the making and selling of the infarnel
stuff. Why, keep that air kind of men in
office, and figuratively speakin, the fust we
know, a pair of the president's breeches will
be stuffed inter a broken winder of that air
White House. Fur if we keep a sendin men
tu Washington, that is friendly tu that air
sarpent with many heads, it will git so big
that it will sartin bust every thing to flinters.
It's leetle young ones are a crawlin everywhere
now. They lay coiled on the hearth
of the rich man and the poor man, and woe
to the infatuated pussen who gits inter their
slimy folds. O, what wretched slaves they
do make of their victims. What tears, what
anguish, what poverty, what degradation du
they bring them tu!</p>

<p>Shall we, the free born sons of America,
consent fur tu be made slaves, and lay among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
the pots? Shall we walk in rags and stagger
in fetters with the blood of the innercent
on our hands? I say, shall this big proud
nation be made fur tu totter and tu reel like
a helpless baby a learnin fur tu walk? Shall
that air many headed sarpent rule us, or shall
we rule it?</p>

<p>Haul out yer temperance pledges! Float
the banner of total abstinence! Wave high
the flag of freedom; and fight long and fight
well fur freedom; from the intoxicatin cup!"</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">he birds are mating, and the spring
will soon open, and when the little songsters
come to you, I am coming with
them," wrote Little Wolf to Mrs. Tinknor in
the month of February.</p>

<p>So now, dear reader, let us skip the intervening
months, and go half way to meet her.
Her friends having planned to carry out their
promise to Captain Green, whose acquain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>tance
and that of his little daughter Flora, it
will be remembered, she formed on her outward
trip; all we have to do is to take passage
on the steamship "Northern Star," Captain
Green, commander, and we will soon have
the pleasure of greeting our heroine.</p>

<p>Little Flora, who has once more been permitted
to accompany her papa, is all impatience,
and almost every hour of the day she
may be heard singing, "O dear, I am so wery,
wery, anxious to see dear Miss DeWolf," and
"papa, ain't you wery, wery, anxious to see
Miss DeWolf?"</p>

<p>The Captain assures his daughter that he
is "wery anxious," and, indeed, when he
says so, his dark eyes kindle, and his fine,
sunburnt countenance glows and warms expressively
under his broad brimmed hat.</p>

<p>The day has come at last, and Little Wolf's
party are aboard, but oh, how changed are
they all!</p>

<p>Consumption has fastened itself upon poor
Alfred Marsden. His days are numbered,
and for earth he seems to have but one de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>sire,
to see again his childhood home, and die
there. His faithful nurses, Annie and Little
Wolf, have grown pale and thin, His sister's
eyes are tear stained, and Little Wolf's also
grief shaded, for together they have watched
over and tended him, striving to drive away
that unseen something, which makes his
cheeks and lips so white, and takes fast hold
upon his vitals, determined to wrench him
away from those he loves.</p>

<p>It will not even grant his last wish; for
here, in mid ocean, he grapples with death.
All day long those fair young faces have bent
over him, and his friend, the Captain, has
been there with them, and little Flora has
hovered near with trembling lips, whispering
softly, "I am so wery, wery, sorry."</p>

<p>As the evening draws on, the sick man revives
a little, and in a low, rapid tone, says
something to his sister, which we do not hear,
but with a few hurried words to Little Wolf,
she moves away with the Captain and Flora,
and Little Wolf is left alone with the dying.
All that he is breathing into her ear we shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
never know; but her cheek changes, and her
lip quivers, and she bends over and kisses
him tenderly.</p>

<p>That hungry look in his eyes is gone. He
is satisfied, and now, surrounded by those he
loves, he dies with a smile upon his lips.</p>

<p>His body will not rest in the place prepared
for him in Greenwood, beside his parents,
but will sink into the ocean's Greenwood,
where the sea shall ever kiss his lips, where
flowers bloom, and things of beauty are perpetual,
and coral monuments are raised, out-rivalling
those of the cemeteries of art.</p>

<p>The fair moon shines out upon the waves
and the winding sheet, and the burial is over.</p>

<p>Three days more, and we shall be on shore
again," says Little Wolf, half regretfully.</p>

<p>The Captain is by her side, and he bends
over and says something which we do not
hear.</p>

<p>Little Wolf shakes her head, and her ingenuous
little face says no, as plainly as
words could.</p>

<p>A shade of disappointment manifests itself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
in the Captain's manner, and again he speaks.</p>

<p>His companion still replies in the negative.</p>

<p>"Then he was but a deer friend, and I
may be the same," says the Captain, now loud
enough to be heard.</p>

<p>Now Little Wolf says distinctly, "yes, you
may be the same, Captain Green. You rescued
me in perils by sea, and he in perils by
land. He told me with his latest breath how
he had saved me from certain destruction
when I was a little child, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And how he loved you in after years, and
how he longed to kiss you," said the Captain,
seeing her hesitate.</p>

<p>"Yes, Captain," said Little Wolf solemnly,
he told me that, and more which you must
not hear."</p>

<p>"I know how he felt," says the Captain,
folding his arms across his breast, "for I
would be willing to die, if you would but kiss
me."</p>

<p>"Captain," Little Wolf's cheek grows scarlet,
and she pauses to choke down a strong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
emotion, "there is a man <i>living</i> whom I have
kissed, and I shall never kiss another."</p>

<p>The Captain's voice sinks very low in reply,
but Little Wolf warmly takes his proffered
hand, and it is easily to be seen that
more than a common friendship has sprung
up between them.</p>

<p>Now the Captain, Little Wolf, Miss Marsden,
and little Flora, have become almost inseparable.
A permanent parting is not once
spoken of between them. Their last day at
sea is spent in planning to be together for the
summer.</p>

<p>It has transpired that Little Wolf's protege,
Fanny Green, is a niece of the Captain's.
His elder brother, Fanny's father, having
formed bad habits, ran away from home, and
it was supposed, went to sea, and had not
been heard of by his family up to the time of
the Captain's acquaintance with Little Wolf.</p>

<p>In the course of a few weeks, the Captain
and Flora, are to accompany Little Wolf and
Miss Marsden to Minnesota, where they ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>pect
to greet their newly discovered little
relative.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, and everything was in
company order at Squire Tinknor's, and
Fanny Green's demure little face looked out
of the window, almost the entire day that
Little Wolf and her friends were to arrive,
and when, just at twilight, a carriage brought
them to the gate, she shrank away in the
folds of the curtain, and Little Wolf found
her there sobbing for joy.</p>

<p>Her cousin Flora greeted her with the remark,
"Why, dear me, how wery, wery large
you are, cousin Fanny; I thought you would
be smaller than me."</p>

<p>Little Wolf found letters awaiting her from
the Hanfords, and Antoinette Le Clare, urging
her to come with her friends and spend a
few weeks at Fairy Knoll.</p>

<p>It was decided that they should accept the
invitation, and accordingly, on a warm summer
morning, a requisition was made on
Squire Tinknor's horses and carriage, and
Tom was installed as driver.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span></p>

<p>Fanny and Flora were to be left with Mrs.
Tinknor, and, as Tom tenderly kissed the
former, his charge to her was, "Take care of
yourself, Fanny dear, for you know you have
promised to be my little wife," and Flora said
that was "wery, wery nice."</p>

<p>The Captain occupied a seat beside Miss
Marsden, and Little Wolf sat by Tom, whom,
having ceased to be a lover, she found to be
quite entertaining, and they amused themselves
by building air castles and earth castles,
such as baloons and orphan asylums; and
indeed, by the time Fairy Knoll loomed up
before them in the moonlight, they had become
warmer friends than they had ever
been.</p>

<p>As they neared the cottage, Little Wolf
could not repress a sigh, for too well did she
remember her emotions on that wintry morning,
when she and Edward Sherman left that
spot together, so light of heart, so full of hope
and joy.</p>

<p>Out sprang the watchers from within, to
welcome their guests, and into the arms of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
Edward Sherman sprang Little Wolf. She
had instantly recognized him, and a glad cry
escaped her, as he caught her to his breast.</p>

<p>The Captain saw all at a glance, and he
then knew whom Little Wolf had kissed, and
who was kissing her. Light also seemed to
have suddenly dawned on Tom's benighted
vision.</p>

<p>Without ceremony or apology, Edward
bore our heroine away to a retired spot in the
grove surrounding the cottage. Their interview
was not interrupted, until Tom, in the
course of half an hour had the temerity to
venture out, and suggest the propriety of Little
Wolf's partaking of a cup of tea.</p>

<p>"Did we not manage it nicely?" said Antoinette
Le Clare to Little Wolf when they
were alone. "Mr. Sherman came out for a
little recreation, and did not think of seeing
you. We made him think that it was his
sister we were expecting, and when he rushed
to meet her and saw who it was you ought
to have seen his face."</p>

<p>On the subject of lovemaking, which was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
witnessed by the trees in the grove at Fairy
Knoll, we will be silent. But the double
wedding which followed was public and
grand, and took place at St. Paul, under Mrs.
Tinknor's supervision.</p>

<p>Miss Marsden returned to New York as
Mrs. Captain Green, and little Flora declared
herself "wery, wery fond of her new mama."</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Sherman accompanied them
as far as the city of Pendleton, where Edward
proposes to make his future home.</p>

<p>At parting Tom wickedly mentioned to
Little Wolf that he was concerned for the
prosperity of that much talked of orphan asylum.
Whereupon the dignified Mrs. Sherman
assured him that having proved himself
so capable of preparing an asylum for the
orphan in which they were mutually interested,
she thought him better adapted to carry
out her benevolent projects than she was,
and consequently would leave the matter in
his hands for the present.</p>

<p>Not long after their marriage Edward Sherman
discovered in his wife's secretary a total<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
abstinence pledge, to which was appended a
long list of names. It was the same which
Mr. Marsden had drawn up on shipboard,
and "Alfred Marsden," headed the list.</p>

<p>Edward took it from its place, and he was
in the act of signing his own name at the bottom,
when a bright curly head came between
him and the paper, and rosy lips whispered,
"Thank you, Edward love, for this free will
offering."</p>
